# VA Benefits Navigator

**Free tools to help veterans understand, file, and win VA disability claims**

## The Problem

- Over 30% of VA claims are denied on first submission
- Veterans wait 125+ days on average for claim decisions
- Many veterans don't know what benefits they qualify for
- VA letters and regulations are confusing and bureaucratic
- C&P exams are often the make-or-break moment, but veterans go in unprepared

## Our Solution

VA Benefits Navigator provides free, accessible tools that guide veterans through every step of the claims process - from understanding what conditions qualify, to preparing for C&P exams, to appealing denials.
