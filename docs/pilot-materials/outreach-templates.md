## VSO Outreach Templates

### Template 1: Cold Outreach to VSO Director/Manager

**Subject:** Free pilot: AI tool to help caseworkers process claims faster

---

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because I built a tool that helps VSO caseworkers identify evidence gaps and decode denial letters in seconds instead of hours.

**Benefits Navigator** uses AI to:
- Instantly analyze claim packets for missing evidence
- Decode VA decision letters into plain English with M21 references
- Generate C&P exam prep guides to share with veterans

I'm looking for 3-5 VSO partners to pilot the platform for 90 days — completely free. In exchange, I'd ask for feedback on what's working and what needs improvement.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if this might help your team?

Best,
[Your name]
[Your email]
[Your phone]

P.S. — I'm a [veteran/veteran family member/etc.] and built this because I saw how overwhelmed VSOs are. Happy to share more about why I started this.

### Template 2: Warm Introduction (via mutual contact)

**Subject:** [Mutual contact] suggested I reach out — VA claims tool for VSOs

---

Hi [Name],

[Mutual contact] mentioned you might be interested in tools that help caseworkers manage their caseload more efficiently.

I built **Benefits Navigator**, an AI-powered assistant that helps VSOs:
- See evidence gaps instantly (no more manual packet review)
- Understand denial letters with M21 manual references
- Share C&P exam prep guides with veterans

We're running a free 90-day pilot with a few VSO partners. [Mutual contact] thought it might be a fit for [Organization].

Would you have 15 minutes this week to take a quick look?

Best,
[Your name]

### Template 3: Follow-up #1 (3 days after initial email)

**Subject:** Re: Free pilot: AI tool to help caseworkers process claims faster

---

Hi [Name],

Just following up on my note from earlier this week. I know you're busy helping veterans — that's exactly why I built this tool.

Quick version: Benefits Navigator helps caseworkers identify evidence gaps in seconds, not hours. Free 90-day pilot, no commitment.

Would a 15-minute demo be helpful? I can work around your schedule.

Best,
[Your name]

### Template 4: Follow-up #2 (7 days after initial email)

**Subject:** One more try — then I'll leave you alone

---

Hi [Name],

I'll keep this short. I've reached out twice about Benefits Navigator, an AI tool that helps VSO caseworkers process claims faster.

If it's not a fit right now, no worries at all. But if you're curious, I'd love 15 minutes to show you what it does.

Either way, thank you for the work you do for veterans.

Best,
[Your name]

### Template 5: Post-Demo Follow-up

**Subject:** Thanks for the demo — next steps for pilot

---

Hi [Name],

Thanks for taking the time to see Benefits Navigator today. I enjoyed learning about how [Organization] handles [specific thing they mentioned].

As we discussed:
- **Pilot duration:** 90 days, completely free
- **What we need:** 3+ active caseworkers, weekly check-ins (15 min), end-of-pilot interview
- **What you get:** Full platform access, priority support, input on the roadmap

I've attached a simple pilot agreement that outlines the terms. Let me know if you have any questions or want to discuss with your team first.

Looking forward to working together.

Best,
[Your name]

## Veteran Power User Templates

### Template 1: Reddit/Forum Outreach

**Subject/Title:** Looking for veterans to test a free VA claims tool (feedback wanted)

---

Hey everyone,

I built a tool called Benefits Navigator that helps veterans understand their VA claims — things like:
- Decoding denial letters into plain English
- Finding evidence gaps before you file
- Calculating your combined rating with VA math
- Prepping for C&P exams

I'm looking for 5-10 veterans who've filed claims before to test it out and give feedback. It's free, and your input will directly shape what gets built next.

**What I'm looking for:**
- You've filed at least one VA claim (doesn't matter if you won or lost)
- You're comfortable trying new software and telling me what sucks
- You can spare 30-60 minutes over the next few weeks

If you're interested, DM me or comment below and I'll send you access.

Thanks for considering it. This is a passion project — I want to make the claims process less painful for everyone.

### Template 2: Direct Message to Veteran

Hey [username],

I saw your post about [their VA claim situation]. That sounds frustrating.

I built a free tool called Benefits Navigator that helps veterans understand denial letters, find evidence gaps, and prep for C&P exams. I'm looking for people to test it and give honest feedback.

Would you be interested in trying it out? No catch — I just want to make sure it actually helps before launching more widely.

Let me know either way. Good luck with your claim.
