## VSO Value Proposition

### The Problem VSOs Face

Veterans Service Organizations are overwhelmed. Caseworkers juggle 50+ active cases, each requiring document review, evidence gap identification, C&P exam preparation, and deadline tracking. The work is manual, error-prone, and time-consuming. Meanwhile, the backlog grows—more veterans need help than VSOs can serve.

### How Benefits Navigator Helps

Benefits Navigator gives caseworkers AI-powered superpowers:

| Pain Point | BN Solution | Time Saved |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| Manual document review | AI summarizes and extracts key info | 15-30 min/doc |
| Evidence gap guesswork | Instant gap analysis with specific recommendations | 1-2 hours/case |
| Denial letter interpretation | Plain-English decode with M21 references | 30-60 min/letter |
| C&P exam prep | Condition-specific guides ready to share | 30 min/veteran |

## Veteran Value Proposition

### The Problem Veterans Face

Filing a VA disability claim feels like navigating a maze blindfolded. Veterans don't know what conditions qualify, what evidence they need, how to prepare for C&P exams, or how to read their decision letters. The system is designed for bureaucrats, not people. And when claims get denied, most veterans don't know how to appeal—or give up entirely.

### How Benefits Navigator Helps

Benefits Navigator translates VA bureaucracy into plain English and guides veterans step-by-step:

| Confusion Point | BN Solution | Benefit |
|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| "What rating will I get?" | VA Rating Calculator with real math | Know before you file |
| "What evidence do I need?" | Evidence Gap Analyzer | Stop guessing, start gathering |
| "Why was I denied?" | Denial Letter Decoder | Understand and respond |
| "What should I say at my exam?" | C&P Exam Guides | Walk in prepared, not scared |
| "What else can I claim?" | Secondary Conditions Hub | Find conditions you didn't know qualified |
| "What do these terms mean?" | VA Glossary | 86 terms in plain English |

### Positioning Statement (Veteran)

> **Benefits Navigator** helps veterans **understand, prepare, and win** VA disability claims. Unlike confusing government websites or expensive claims agents, BN provides free tools that explain the process in plain English—from calculating your rating, to preparing for your C&P exam, to appealing a denial.

1. **"Know your rating before you file."** The VA Rating Calculator uses real VA math so you can see what to expect.

3. **"Understand why you were denied."** Upload your decision letter, get a plain-English explanation and specific next steps.

4. **"Find conditions you didn't know qualified."** The Secondary Conditions Hub shows 40+ documented connections that could increase your rating.
