# Benefits Navigator — Pricing Hypothesis

*Week 2 Deliverable for 90-Day Execution Plan*

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines pricing hypotheses for both veteran (B2C) and VSO (B2B) customer segments. These are starting points for pilot validation, not final pricing.

**Key assumptions to validate:**
- Veterans are price-sensitive but will pay for confidence/time savings
- VSOs value efficiency gains and will pay per-seat for caseworker tools
- Free tiers drive adoption; paid tiers capture value from power users

## Part 1: Veteran Pricing Model (B2C)

### 1.1 Current Free Tier Limits

| Resource | Free Limit | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Document uploads | 3/month | Enough to try the product; limits heavy use |
| Storage | 100 MB | ~20-30 typical VA documents |
| Denial decodes | 2/month | Test the AI value; premium unlocks more |
| AI analyses | 5/month | Rating, evidence gap, statement generation |
| Rating calculator | Unlimited | Lead magnet, no marginal cost |
| Exam guides | Unlimited | Content marketing, builds trust |
| Glossary | Unlimited | SEO value, low friction entry |

### 1.2 Premium Tier Hypothesis

**Price point: $19/month or $149/year ($12.42/month)**

| Feature | Premium Access |
|---------|---------------|
| Document uploads | Unlimited |
| Storage | 1 GB |
| Denial decodes | Unlimited |
| AI analyses | Unlimited |
| Priority processing | Yes |
| Export to PDF | Yes |
| Saved calculations | Unlimited |
| Email support | Yes |

### 1.3 Pricing Rationale

**Why $19/month:**
- Below psychological $20 threshold
- Comparable to legal document services (LegalZoom: $10-30/month)
- Significantly cheaper than hiring a claims agent ($100-500)
- 1 hour of attorney time equivalent (~$150-300)
- If it helps win even a 10% rating increase, ROI is massive ($150+/month lifetime)

**Annual discount rationale:**
- 35% discount for annual commitment
- Reduces churn, improves cash flow
- Veterans on fixed income prefer predictable costs

### 1.4 Conversion Funnel Assumptions

| Stage | Target Rate |
|-------|-------------|
| Visitor → Signup | 5-10% |
| Signup → Upload first doc | 30-40% |
| Free → Premium | 3-5% |
| Annual vs Monthly | 40% annual |

### 1.5 Price Sensitivity Considerations

**Factors suggesting lower price sensitivity:**
- High stakes (lifetime monthly payments at risk)
- No good free alternatives for AI analysis
- VSOs are overloaded; veterans need self-service options
- Emotional investment in claim outcome

**Factors suggesting higher price sensitivity:**
- Many veterans on fixed/limited income
- Free VSO assistance available (but scarce)
- Distrust of "veteran-targeted" products (scam fatigue)

### 1.6 Alternatives Considered

| Price Point | Pros | Cons |
|-------------|------|------|
| $9/month | Lower barrier, higher conversion | May not cover AI costs; perceived as "cheap" |
| $19/month | Sweet spot; sustainable unit economics | Some price-sensitive veterans excluded |
| $29/month | Higher margin; premium positioning | Conversion drop; harder to justify vs free VSO |
| $49/month | High-value professional tool | Too expensive for individual veterans |

**Recommendation:** Start at $19/month, test $14.99 if conversion is low.

## Part 2: VSO Pricing Model (B2B)

### 2.1 Pricing Structure Options

#### Option A: Per-Seat Pricing

| Tier | Price/Seat/Month | Includes |
|------|------------------|----------|
| Caseworker | $49/month | Full case management, AI tools, document sharing |
| Admin | $49/month | Same as caseworker + org management |
| Veteran (linked) | Free | Read-only access to shared analyses |

**Minimum commitment:** 2 seats
**Volume discounts:** 10+ seats = 15% off, 25+ seats = 25% off

#### Option B: Organization License

| Org Size | Monthly Price | Per-seat equivalent |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Small (1-5 users) | $149/month | $30-149/seat |
| Medium (6-15 users) | $349/month | $23-58/seat |
| Large (16-50 users) | $749/month | $15-47/seat |
| Enterprise (50+) | Custom | Negotiated |

#### Option C: Hybrid (Recommended for Pilot)

Base platform fee + per-active-case fee:
- Platform fee: $99/month (unlimited users)
- Per active case: $5/month (cases with activity in billing period)

**Why hybrid works:**
- Low barrier to entry for small VSOs
- Scales with actual usage/value delivered
- Predictable for budgeting (cap at X cases)

### 2.2 Pilot Pricing (Recommended)

**Pilot terms: 90 days, no cost**

| What's Included | Pilot | Post-Pilot |
|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Full platform access | Yes | Yes |
| All AI features | Yes | Yes |
| Unlimited cases | Yes | Subject to tier |
| Priority support | Yes | Paid tiers only |
| Price | Free | TBD based on feedback |

**Pilot commitments from VSO:**
- Minimum 3 active caseworkers
- Weekly feedback check-ins (15 min)
- End-of-pilot interview (30 min)
- Permission to use anonymized metrics

### 2.3 VSO Budget Sensitivity

**What we know:**
- Small VSOs (county/local): Often volunteer-run, minimal budget ($0-500/month for tools)
- Medium VSOs (state/regional): Some paid staff, modest tech budget ($500-2000/month)
- Large VSOs (national orgs): Dedicated IT, meaningful budgets ($5000+/month)
- VA-accredited claims agents: Higher margins, can afford premium tools

**Budget benchmarks:**
- Case management software: $30-100/user/month (Salesforce, Monday.com)
- Legal practice management: $50-150/user/month (Clio, MyCase)
- VA-specific tools: Limited market data; mostly free or grant-funded

### 2.4 Value Metrics to Track

To validate pricing, measure pilot outcomes:

| Metric | Baseline (estimate) | Target with BN |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|
| Cases per caseworker/month | 15-20 | 25-30 (+50%) |
| Time to claim readiness | 2-3 weeks | 1-2 weeks |
| Evidence gap identification | Manual review | Instant AI scan |
| Win rate | ~70% | ~80% (+10 points) |
| Appeal success rate | ~50% | ~60% (+10 points) |

**ROI calculation for VSOs:**
- If caseworker handles 10 more cases/month
- At $49/seat, that's $4.90/case
- Value of successful claim to veteran: $1000s-$10,000s/year

### 2.5 Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | Price | Positioning |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| VetPro (claims software) | ~$100/user/month | Full practice management |
| Generic CRM (Salesforce) | $25-150/user/month | Not VA-specific |
| Spreadsheets/paper | Free | Status quo |
| Benefits Navigator | $49/user/month | AI-powered, VA-specific, modern |

**Our differentiator:** AI-powered evidence gap analysis and denial decoding — no competitor offers this.

## Part 3: Pricing Validation Plan

### 3.1 Veteran Pricing Validation

| Test | Method | Success Criteria |
|------|--------|------------------|
| Price point survey | In-app survey at upgrade prompt | >50% say "fair" or "good value" |
| A/B test $14.99 vs $19.99 | 50/50 split on pricing page | <20% conversion difference |
| Annual vs monthly | Default to annual with monthly option | >30% choose annual |
| Churn analysis | Track cancellations by price point | <10% monthly churn |

### 3.2 VSO Pricing Validation

| Test | Method | Success Criteria |
|------|--------|------------------|
| Pilot feedback | End-of-pilot interview | "Would pay $X/month" |
| Willingness to pay survey | Structured questions | Identify ceiling and floor |
| Usage correlation | Track feature usage vs perceived value | High-value features = high-use features |
| Competitive switch | Ask about current tools and budget | Understand replacement dynamics |

## Part 5: Open Questions

1. **Should veterans get free access if referred by a VSO partner?**
   - Pro: Drives VSO adoption, helps veterans
   - Con: Cannibalizes B2C revenue

2. **Should we offer a "pro bono" tier for low-income veterans?**
   - Pro: Mission alignment, positive PR
   - Con: Verification complexity, potential abuse

3. **What's the right pilot length for VSOs?**
   - 30 days: Fast feedback, may not see full value
   - 90 days: See multiple cases through; higher commitment
   - 6 months: Full claim cycle; very high commitment

4. **Per-seat vs per-case pricing for VSOs?**
   - Per-seat: Predictable, simple
   - Per-case: Usage-based, fairer for small orgs
