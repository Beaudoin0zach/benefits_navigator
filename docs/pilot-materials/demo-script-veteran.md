## Common Questions

**Q: Is my data secure?**
> "Yes. We never store raw medical text — AI processes it and discards the original. Your VA file number and DOB are encrypted. You control who sees your data."

**Q: Is this legal advice?**
> "No. This is an educational tool. For legal advice, consult an accredited VA attorney or representative."

**Q: How accurate is the AI?**
> "The AI is helpful but not perfect. Always verify important information. Use this as a starting point, not the final word."

**Q: How much does it cost?**
> "Basic features are free. Premium features (unlimited documents, saved analyses) are $X/month. Pilot users get extended free access."

**Q: Can I use this on my phone?**
> "The web app works on mobile browsers. A dedicated mobile app is planned."

**Q: What if I already filed?**
> "You can still use BN to understand your decision and prepare an appeal or supplemental claim."
