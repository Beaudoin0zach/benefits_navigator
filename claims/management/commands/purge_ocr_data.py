"""
Management command to purge raw OCR text from the database.

This command was part of the Ephemeral OCR Refactor (PR 5) to eliminate PHI storage.

NOTE: As of PR 6, the ocr_text, raw_text fields have been REMOVED from the database
schema entirely. This command is now deprecated and exists only for historical reference.

The PHI text fields were:
- Document.ocr_text (removed in migration 0003)
- DecisionLetterAnalysis.raw_text (removed in migration 0008)
- RatingAnalysis.raw_text (removed in migration 0008)

These fields no longer exist in the models. All OCR text is now ephemeral - extracted
from documents only during processing and never persisted to the database.
