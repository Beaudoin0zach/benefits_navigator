    "introduction": "## Understanding the Mental Health C&P Exam\n\nMental health conditions like depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and others are evaluated using the same criteria under 38 CFR 4.130 - the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders. This exam is your opportunity to show how your condition affects your daily life.\n\n**Key Fact:** The VA uses the SAME rating criteria for virtually ALL mental health conditions (except eating disorders). Whether you have depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, OCD, or schizophrenia - the rating is based on how your symptoms affect your ability to work and function socially.\n\n**Why This Exam Matters:**\n- Mental health conditions are rated from 0% to 100%\n- Ratings are based on FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT, not just symptoms\n- Many veterans are underrated because they minimize symptoms\n- The exam captures one moment - you must describe your overall picture\n\n**Important Rule:** You can only receive ONE mental health rating. If you have both depression AND anxiety, they're rated together as one combined mental health condition. The VA doesn't give separate ratings for each mental health diagnosis.\n\n**Conditions Covered by This Exam:**\n- Major Depressive Disorder\n- Generalized Anxiety Disorder\n- Panic Disorder\n- Social Anxiety Disorder\n- Bipolar Disorder\n- Schizophrenia/Schizoaffective Disorder\n- Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)\n- Adjustment Disorder\n- Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)\n- Somatic Symptom Disorder\n\n**Note:** If your claim includes PTSD, you'll use the PTSD DBQ, but the rating criteria are identical.",
    "what_exam_measures": "## What the Mental Health Exam Measures\n\nThe VA rates mental health conditions based on OCCUPATIONAL AND SOCIAL IMPAIRMENT - how your symptoms affect your ability to work and maintain relationships.\n\n### The Rating Scale\n\n**0% - Diagnosed but No Impairment**\n- Condition diagnosed but symptoms don't interfere with functioning\n- No medication needed\n- This rating is rare\n\n**10% - Mild Impairment**\n- Symptoms only cause problems during significant stress\n- Symptoms controlled by medication\n- Can generally perform occupational tasks\n\n**30% - Occasional Impairment**\n- Occasional decrease in work efficiency\n- Intermittent periods of inability to perform tasks\n- Generally functioning satisfactorily\n- Normal routine behavior, self-care, conversation\n\n**50% - Reduced Reliability and Productivity**\nTypical symptoms at this level:\n- Panic attacks more than once per week\n- Difficulty understanding complex commands\n- Impaired judgment and abstract thinking\n- Disturbances of motivation and mood\n- Difficulty maintaining work and social relationships\n\n**70% - Deficiencies in Most Areas**\nTypical symptoms at this level:\n- Suicidal ideation\n- Near-continuous panic or depression\n- Impaired impulse control\n- Difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances\n- Inability to establish/maintain effective relationships\n- Neglect of personal appearance/hygiene\n- Speech issues (illogical, obscure)\n\n**100% - Total Impairment**\nTypical symptoms at this level:\n- Persistent delusions or hallucinations\n- Grossly inappropriate behavior\n- Persistent danger of hurting self or others\n- Cannot perform activities of daily living\n- Disoriented to time or place\n- Memory loss for close relatives, occupation, own name\n\n### Key Insight\nThe symptom lists are EXAMPLES, not requirements. You don't need every symptom listed - these are illustrative. Your overall level of occupational and social impairment determines your rating.",
    "physical_tests": "## What Happens During the Exam\n\nThe mental health C&P exam is primarily an interview. There are no blood tests or physical measurements - the examiner evaluates you based on your reported symptoms, observed behavior, and medical records.\n\n### Exam Components\n\n**1. Review of Records**\nThe examiner should review:\n- Your claims file\n- Medical treatment records\n- Previous exam reports\n- Any evidence you've submitted\n\n**2. Clinical Interview**\nThe examiner will ask detailed questions about:\n- Your symptoms and their frequency\n- How symptoms affect daily life\n- Work history and problems\n- Relationships and social functioning\n- Medication and treatment history\n- Hospitalizations\n\n**3. Mental Status Examination**\nThe examiner observes and documents:\n- **Appearance**: Grooming, hygiene, appropriate dress\n- **Behavior**: Eye contact, psychomotor activity, agitation\n- **Speech**: Rate, rhythm, volume, coherence\n- **Mood**: What you report feeling (sad, anxious, irritable)\n- **Affect**: What they observe (flat, appropriate, labile)\n- **Thought Process**: Logical, organized, or disordered\n- **Thought Content**: Suicidal/homicidal ideation, delusions\n- **Perception**: Hallucinations (auditory, visual)\n- **Cognition**: Orientation, memory, concentration\n- **Insight and Judgment**: Understanding of condition\n\n**4. Functional Assessment**\nThey'll assess your ability to:\n- Maintain employment\n- Manage daily responsibilities\n- Maintain relationships\n- Care for yourself\n- Manage finances\n\n### Exam Duration\nA thorough mental health exam typically lasts 45-90 minutes. If your exam is very short (under 30 minutes), it may be inadequate.",

    "preparation_tips": "## Preparation Tips\n\n### 2 Weeks Before\n\n**1. Obtain the DBQ**\nSearch for 'VA Mental Disorders DBQ' (VA Form 21-0960P-2) to understand what will be evaluated.\n\n**2.

    "day_of_guidance": "## Day-of Guidance\n\n### The Most Important Rule\n**Describe your OVERALL functioning, not just how you feel TODAY.**\n\nIf you're having a 'good day,' tell the examiner: 'Today is actually a better day than usual. Most days I...' Don't let one good day become your baseline.\n\n### What to Bring\n- Symptom journal with specific examples\n- List of medications\n- Buddy/lay statements\n- Any records not already in your claims file\n- List of questions or concerns\n\n### How to Present Yourself\n\n**Don't:**\n- Dress up nicely to look 'presentable'\n- Hide poor hygiene or disheveled appearance\n- Put on a brave face or minimize symptoms\n- Say 'I'm fine' or 'I manage'\n- Compare yourself to 'people who have it worse'\n\n**Do:**\n- Present yourself as you are on a typical day\n- Be honest about hygiene struggles if they exist\n- Describe symptoms honestly, even embarrassing ones\n- Share specific examples\n- Describe your worst days\n\n### Communication Tips\n\n**Instead of:** 'I get sad sometimes'\n**Say:** 'I feel hopeless most days. Last week I cried for 2 hours and couldn't get out of bed for 3 days. I've thought about whether my family would be better off without me.'\n\n**Instead of:** 'I have some anxiety'\n**Say:** 'I have panic attacks 3-4 times per week. My heart races, I can't breathe, and I feel like I'm dying. I haven't been to the store in 2 months because I'm afraid of having an attack in public.'\n\n**Instead of:** 'Work is hard'\n**Say:** 'I was fired from my last job because I missed 12 days in 3 months. I couldn't concentrate, made mistakes, and had conflicts with coworkers. Before that, I was fired for the same reasons.'\n\n**Instead of:** 'I don't really have friends'\n**Say:** 'I had 5 close friends before my symptoms started. Now I have none. I don't answer calls. I canceled on people so many times they stopped inviting me. My wife says she doesn't recognize me anymore.'\n\n### Topics to Definitely Mention\n- Suicidal thoughts (if present) - be honest\n- Hospitalizations\n- Medication side effects\n- Impact on marriage/relationships\n- Why you can't work (or struggle at work)\n- Things you used to do but can't anymore\n- Times you've been unable to leave the house\n- Hygiene or self-care struggles\n- Financial problems caused by symptoms",
    "common_mistakes": "## Common Mistakes\n\n### Mistake 1: Minimizing Symptoms\n**The Problem:** Military culture teaches you to be strong and not complain. This hurts you in this exam.\n\n**Example:** Saying 'I'm managing' when you're struggling daily.\n\n**Solution:** Describe symptoms honestly. 'Managing' to a veteran might mean 'barely surviving' to a civilian. Explain what 'managing' actually looks like.\n\n### Mistake 2: Describing a Good Day\n**The Problem:** If you feel okay during the exam, you might present a misleadingly positive picture.\n\n**Solution:** Always clarify: 'Today is a better day than usual. Most days I...' Describe your overall functioning, not just exam-day feelings.\n\n### Mistake 3: Being Too Vague\n**The Problem:** General statements like 'I have depression' don't show severity.\n\n**Solution:** Use specific examples with frequency:\n- 'I have panic attacks 4-5 times per week'\n- 'I stayed in bed for 3 days last week'\n- 'I've been fired from 4 jobs in 2 years'\n\n### Mistake 4: Not Mentioning Suicidal Ideation\n**The Problem:** Veterans often hide suicidal thoughts from fear of hospitalization.\n\n**Solution:** Suicidal ideation is a major factor in ratings (70%+). Be honest. Having thoughts is different from having a plan or intent. You won't be hospitalized for passive ideation.\n\n### Mistake 5: Overlooking Social Impairment\n**The Problem:** Focusing only on work issues and not relationships.\n\n**Solution:** Describe impact on ALL relationships:\n- Spouse/partner\n- Children\n- Extended family\n- Friends\n- Coworkers\n\n### Mistake 6: Good Appearance = Good Rating\n**The Problem:** Dressing nicely, good grooming, and 'putting on a good face' suggests you're functioning well.\n\n**Solution:** Present yourself as you are on a typical day. If you struggle with hygiene, don't clean up specifically for the exam. If you normally look disheveled, don't dress up.\n\n### Mistake 7: Not Documenting Everything\n**The Problem:** Forgetting to mention important symptoms or incidents.\n\n**Solution:** Bring a written symptom log. Reference it during the exam. It's not cheating - it's ensuring accuracy.\n\n### Mistake 8: Thinking the Examiner Read Your File\n**The Problem:** Assuming they know your history and symptoms.\n\n**Solution:** Explain everything as if they know nothing. Cover all symptoms and impacts, even if you think it's in your records.\n\n### Mistake 9: Not Mentioning Medication Side Effects\n**The Problem:** Side effects can be impairing and relevant to your claim.\n\n**Solution:** Mention all side effects: weight gain, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, cognitive fog, etc.",
