    "introduction": "## Musculoskeletal Exams: Back, Knee, Shoulder, Hip\n\nMusculoskeletal conditions are among the most commonly claimed disabilities. These exams focus heavily on Range of Motion (ROM) measurements and functional limitations.\n\n**Why These Exams Matter:**\nYour rating depends directly on ROM measurements and pain documentation. Understanding how these tests work helps you communicate accurately and avoid common mistakes.\n\n**Key Concept - Painful Motion:**\nFor musculoskeletal conditions, WHERE PAIN STARTS is critical. If you push through pain to show full range of motion, the examiner documents 'full ROM' and you get a lower rating.\n\n**What Determines Your Rating:**\n- How far you can move the joint (ROM in degrees)\n- Where pain begins during movement\n- Functional limitations (what you can't do)\n- Flare-ups (how bad days affect you)\n- Instability, weakness, or other factors\n\n**Common Conditions Covered:**\n- Back (thoracolumbar spine)\n- Neck (cervical spine)\n- Knees\n- Shoulders\n- Hips\n- Ankles, elbows, wrists",
    "what_exam_measures": "## What the Exam Measures\n\nThe examiner fills out a DBQ specific to your joint, documenting:\n\n**Range of Motion (ROM):**\n- Measured in degrees using a goniometer (protractor-like tool)\n- Each joint has 'normal' ROM values\n- Your ROM is compared to normal\n- Both pain-free ROM and total ROM are recorded\n\n**Normal ROM Values (for reference):**\n- **Back (Forward Flexion):** 90 degrees normal\n- **Knee (Flexion):** 140 degrees normal\n- **Shoulder (Abduction):** 180 degrees normal\n\n**Pain on Motion:**\n- Where pain begins during movement\n- 'Painful motion' can support higher ratings\n- Examiner should document pain point\n\n**Functional Loss:**\n- What activities are limited?\n- Impact on work and daily life\n- Effect of pain on function\n\n**Flare-ups:**\n- How often do bad days occur?\n- How severe are they?\n- Examiner estimates ROM during flare-ups\n\n**Other Factors:**\n- Weakness\n- Instability (giving way)\n- Fatigability\n- Lack of endurance\n- Incoordination",
    "physical_tests": "## Physical Tests\n\n**Goniometer Measurement:**\nThe examiner uses a goniometer (angle-measuring tool) to measure how far you can move your joint.\n\n**Active vs. Passive ROM:**\n- **Active ROM:** YOU move the joint yourself\n- **Passive ROM:** Examiner moves your joint\n- Both should be tested\n\n**For Back Conditions:**\n- Forward flexion (bending forward)\n- Extension (bending backward)\n- Lateral flexion (bending side to side)\n- Rotation (twisting)\n\n**For Knee Conditions:**\n- Flexion (bending the knee)\n- Extension (straightening the knee)\n- Stability tests (ACL, MCL, etc.)\n\n**For Shoulder Conditions:**\n- Forward flexion (raising arm forward)\n- Abduction (raising arm to side)\n- Internal/external rotation\n- Strength testing\n\n**Repetitive Motion Testing:**\n- You may be asked to repeat movements 3 times\n- Documents if pain increases with repetition\n- Shows if fatigue affects ROM\n\n**Weight-Bearing vs. Non-Weight-Bearing:**\n- May test both positions\n- Standing vs. lying down\n\n**CRITICAL POINT:**\nSTOP AT THE POINT OF PAIN. Don't push through to show you can go further. Tell the examiner: 'This is where pain stops me.'",
    "questions_to_expect": "## Questions to Expect\n\n**History Questions:**\n- When did this condition start?\n- Was there a specific injury?\n- How has it changed over time?\n- What treatments have you tried?\n- Have you had surgery? Physical therapy?\n\n**Current Symptoms:**\n- What is your pain level today (1-10)?\n- Is pain constant or intermittent?\n- What makes it better or worse?\n- Does pain radiate (travel) anywhere?\n\n**Flare-up Questions:**\n- Do you have flare-ups (periods when it's worse)?\n- How often do they occur?\n- How long do they last?\n- What triggers them?\n- How severe are they compared to average days?\n- What can/can't you do during flare-ups?\n\n**Functional Impact:**\n- Can you work? What are your limitations?\n- How long can you stand? Sit? Walk?\n- Can you lift? How much?\n- Does it affect sleep?\n- Do you use assistive devices (cane, brace, wheelchair)?\n- What activities have you had to stop?\n\n**Sample Questions:**\n- 'How long can you stand before you need to sit down?'\n- 'Can you climb stairs? How many?'\n- 'How far can you walk before needing to rest?'\n- 'Can you bend down to pick something up?'\n- 'Does this affect your ability to work?'",
    "preparation_tips": "## Preparation Tips\n\n**2 Weeks Before:**\n- Find the DBQ for your specific joint (search 'VA DBQ back/knee/shoulder')\n- Research normal ROM values for your joint\n- Understand how ROM relates to rating percentages\n\n**1 Week Before:**\n- Document your symptoms in writing:\n  - Average pain level\n  - Worst pain level (flare-ups)\n  - Frequency of flare-ups\n  - Duration of flare-ups\n- List specific functional limitations:\n  - Can't lift more than X pounds\n  - Can't stand more than X minutes\n  - Can't sit more than X minutes\n  - Can't walk more than X distance\n  - Specific activities you can't do\n- Gather recent imaging (X-ray, MRI) if not already submitted\n\n**Day Before:**\n- Plan comfortable, loose clothing\n  - Shorts for knee exams\n  - Tank top or loose shirt for shoulder\n  - Easy-to-remove clothing for back\n- Review your notes\n- DON'T take extra pain medication\n\n**Morning Of:**\n- Take normal medications only (no extra pain meds)\n- Eat normally\n- Wear planned clothing\n- Bring your written notes and documentation\n\n**What to Bring:**\n- Written symptom summary\n- List of functional limitations\n- Medication list\n- Recent imaging reports (if available)\n- Assistive devices you use (brace, cane)",
    "day_of_guidance": "## Day-of Guidance\n\n**THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE:**\n**STOP AT THE POINT OF PAIN DURING ROM TESTS**\n\nDo NOT push through pain to show full range of motion. If you do, the examiner documents 'full ROM' and your rating will be lower.\n\n**How to Communicate During ROM Testing:**\n- 'That's where pain stops me'\n- 'I can only go this far before pain'\n- 'This is my pain-free range of motion'\n- 'If I push further, the pain becomes severe'\n\n**If Examiner Pushes Your Joint Further:**\nThe examiner should NOT force your joint past your pain point. If they do, clearly state: 'That hurts. I cannot go that far without pain.'\n\n**Describe Pain Level:**\nUse the 1-10 scale:\n- Where does pain start? What level?\n- Where does pain become severe?\n- What is your resting pain level?\n\n**Don't Forget Flare-ups:**\nIf the examiner doesn't ask, VOLUNTEER information about bad days:\n- 'On average days I can bend this far, but during flare-ups I can barely move'\n- 'My worst days are X times per month and last X days'\n- 'During flare-ups, I can't [specific activities]'\n\n**Communication Examples:**\n\n*Instead of:* Pushing to touch your toes during back flexion\n*Say:* 'I can only bend to here before pain. This is my normal limit. On bad days, I can barely bend at all.'\n\n*Instead of:* 'My knee hurts'\n*Say:* 'My knee pain is constant at 4/10. When I bend past 90 degrees, it jumps to 7/10. During flare-ups (twice a week), it's 8/10 and I can't put weight on it.'\n\n*Instead of:* 'I can't do much'\n*Say:* 'I can't lift more than 10 pounds, can't stand more than 15 minutes, can't walk more than one block, and can't sit through a movie without getting up to stretch.'",
    "common_mistakes": "## Common Mistakes\n\n**Mistake 1: PUSHING PAST PAIN TO SHOW FULL ROM**\nThis is THE #1 mistake. Military culture says 'push through.' In a C&P exam, this HURTS YOU.\n- Examiner documents 'full range of motion'\n- You get a lower rating\n- STOP where pain begins. Say 'pain stops me here.'\n\n**Mistake 2: Taking Extra Pain Medication Before Exam**\nDon't mask your symptoms. Take only your normal medications. The examiner needs to see your actual function, not your best-case scenario.\n\n**Mistake 3: Not Mentioning Flare-ups**\nIf you only describe 'today,' you're not giving the full picture. Describe your worst days:\n- How often they occur\n- How long they last\n- How severe they are\n- What you can't do during them\n\n**Mistake 4: Not Explaining Functional Limitations**\nDon't just describe pain - describe what you CAN'T DO:\n- Specific weight limits\n- Time limits for standing, sitting, walking\n- Activities you've had to stop\n- Impact on work\n\n**Mistake 5: Wearing Restrictive Clothing**\nWear loose, comfortable clothing that allows easy movement and access to the joint being examined.\n\n**Mistake 6: Not Documenting Painful Motion**\nIf you feel pain during a movement, SAY SO. The examiner should document where pain begins, not just your maximum ROM.\n\n**Mistake 7: Forgetting Assistive Devices**\nBring any brace, cane, or support you use. Using assistive devices supports your claim.\n\n**Mistake 8: Inconsistency**\nBe honest and consistent. If you tell the examiner you can't walk but walked normally into the building, explain: 'I can walk short distances but pay for it later' or 'Today is a better day.'",
    "after_exam": "## After the Exam\n\n**Immediately After:**\n- Document everything while fresh\n- Note ROM measurements if you saw them\n- Record if examiner pushed past your pain point\n- Write down any painful motion during tests\n- Note if anything seemed incomplete\n\n**What to Document:**\n- Questions asked\n- Tests performed\n- How long exam lasted\n- Whether examiner asked about flare-ups\n- Whether pain was documented during ROM\n- Any concerns about the exam\n\n**Getting Your Results:**\n- Request exam report through VA.gov\n- Review ROM measurements for accuracy\n- Check that examiner documented:\n  - Your pain points\n  - Flare-up information\n  - Functional limitations\n  - Repetitive use effects\n\n**If ROM Measurements Seem Wrong:**\nIf documented ROM doesn't match what happened:\n- File a statement describing the discrepancy\n- Note if examiner pushed past your pain point\n- Contact your VSO\n- You may be entitled to a new exam\n\n**Timeline:**\n- Exam results typically processed within 1-2 weeks\n- Overall decision: 3-4 months after exam average\n- Decision letter sent by mail\n\n**If Rated Too Low:**\nYou can appeal:\n- Supplemental Claim with new evidence (new medical records, buddy statements)\n- Higher-Level Review if you believe there was an error\n- Board Appeal for complex cases",

    "introduction": "## Tinnitus and Hearing Loss Exams\n\nTinnitus and hearing loss are among the most common VA claims, especially for veterans exposed to loud noise (weapons fire, aircraft, machinery, explosions).\n\n**Understanding the Ratings:**\n- **Tinnitus:** Maximum 10% rating, regardless of severity. Even though it's 'only' 10%, it's often the easiest condition to service-connect and can help establish other claims.\n- **Hearing Loss:** Rated 0-100% based on audiometric test results. Rating depends on measured hearing levels, not just symptoms.\n\n**What This Exam Involves:**\n- Audiometry testing in a sound booth (hearing test)\n- Questions about your hearing and tinnitus\n- Physical examination of your ears\n- No pain involved\n\n**Why Noise Exposure Matters:**\nDocumenting military noise exposure is critical. Common sources:\n- Weapons fire (rifles, machine guns, mortars)\n- Aircraft (flight line, helicopters)\n- Explosions (IEDs, artillery, grenades)\n- Heavy machinery and vehicles\n- Industrial equipment",
    "what_exam_measures": "## What the Exam Measures\n\n**Hearing Loss:**\nThe audiometry test measures your hearing at different frequencies (pitches):\n- Pure tone audiometry (listening for beeps)\n- Speech recognition testing (repeating words)\n- Results plotted on an audiogram\n\n**How Hearing Loss Is Rated:**\nThe VA uses a formula based on:\n- Pure tone thresholds at 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz\n- Speech recognition scores (Maryland CNC word test)\n- Results converted to a rating percentage using VA tables\n\n**Key Point:** Hearing loss ratings are determined by TEST RESULTS, not by how much you feel affected. The audiometry numbers drive the rating.\n\n**Tinnitus:**\nThe exam documents:\n- Presence of tinnitus (ringing, buzzing, hissing)\n- Whether it's constant or intermittent\n- Which ear(s) affected\n- Impact on daily life, sleep, concentration\n\n**Tinnitus Rating:**\n- 10% is the maximum rating\n- Applies whether tinnitus is in one or both ears\n- Service connection is key - if connected, you get 10%\n\n**What the Examiner Documents:**\n- Audiometry results\n- Speech recognition scores\n- Tinnitus characteristics\n- Impact on daily functioning\n- Connection to military noise exposure",
    "physical_tests": "## Physical Tests\n\n**Audiometry Booth Testing:**\nThis is the main test - sitting in a sound-treated booth with headphones.\n\n**Pure Tone Audiometry:**\n- You wear headphones\n- Listen for tones (beeps) at different pitches\n- Raise your hand or press a button when you hear a tone\n- Tones will get quieter until you can barely hear them\n- Tests each ear separately\n\n**Critical Instructions:**\n- Only respond when you ACTUALLY hear a tone\n- Don't guess or anticipate\n- Don't raise hand if you're not sure\n- It's okay to hear nothing at some frequencies\n- Some tones are meant to be very quiet or inaudible\n\n**Speech Recognition Testing:**\n- You'll hear recorded words through headphones\n- Repeat each word back\n- Tests how well you understand speech\n- Uses standardized word lists (Maryland CNC)\n\n**Otoscope Examination:**\n- Examiner looks in your ears with a light\n- Checks for blockage, damage, or abnormalities\n- Quick and painless\n\n**No Pain Involved:**\nThe hearing test is completely non-invasive. You're just listening and responding.",
    "questions_to_expect": "## Questions to Expect\n\n**About Hearing Loss:**\n- When did you first notice hearing problems?\n- Was there a specific event (explosion, prolonged exposure)?\n- Has it gotten worse over time?\n- Which ear is worse?\n- Do you use hearing aids?\n- Do you have trouble understanding conversations?\n\n**About Tinnitus:**\n- Do you experience ringing, buzzing, hissing, or other sounds in your ears?\n- When did it start?\n- Is it constant or does it come and go?\n- Which ear(s)?\n- How would you describe the sound?\n- How loud is it?\n- Does it affect sleep?\n- Does it affect concentration?\n- Does it affect your mood?\n\n**About Military Noise Exposure:**\n- What was your MOS/job?\n- What types of noise were you exposed to?\n- How often were you exposed?\n- Did you use hearing protection? Always, sometimes, never?\n- Were there any specific loud events (explosions, weapons fire)?\n\n**About Daily Impact:**\n- How does hearing loss affect your work?\n- Do you have trouble in conversations?\n- Do you need things repeated?\n- Do you turn up the TV/phone volume?\n- How does tinnitus affect your daily life?\n- Does tinnitus interfere with sleep or concentration?",
    "preparation_tips": "## Preparation Tips\n\n**2 Weeks Before:**\n- Review your service records for noise exposure documentation\n- Research your MOS noise exposure (many MOSs have documented noise hazards)\n- Gather any civilian audiograms you may have\n\n**1 Week Before:**\n- Document all military noise exposure:\n  - Weapons (what type, how often)\n  - Aircraft (flight line work, helicopter rides)\n  - Explosions (IEDs, artillery, grenades)\n  - Machinery and vehicles\n  - Any specific loud events\n- Document tinnitus characteristics:\n  - When did it start?\n  - Constant or intermittent?\n  - Sound type (ringing, buzzing, hissing, roaring)\n  - Which ear(s)?\n  - Volume level\n  - Impact on sleep\n  - Impact on concentration\n  - Impact on mood/quality of life\n\n**Day Before:**\n- Avoid loud noise exposure (concerts, power tools, loud music)\n- Don't use earplugs or anything that might affect ears\n- Get good sleep\n\n**Morning Of:**\n- No special preparation needed\n- Don't clean ears excessively\n- Take normal medications",
    "day_of_guidance": "## Day-of Guidance\n\n**During Audiometry Testing:**\n\n**CRITICAL: Only respond when you ACTUALLY hear a tone**\n- Don't guess\n- Don't anticipate tones\n- Don't raise hand if you're unsure\n- It's okay to hear nothing at some frequencies\n- Some tones are designed to be at the edge of hearing\n\n**Why This Matters:**\nIf you guess or respond when you don't really hear something, your hearing will appear BETTER than it is, resulting in a lower rating.\n\n**During Speech Recognition:**\n- Listen carefully to each word\n- Repeat what you hear\n- If you're not sure, say your best guess\n- It's okay to say 'I didn't hear that'\n\n**Describing Tinnitus:**\nBe detailed and specific:\n\n*Instead of:* 'I have ringing in my ears'\n*Say:* 'I have constant ringing in both ears. It started in 2012 after an IED explosion. The sound is high-pitched, like a constant tone. It's worse at night and makes it hard to fall asleep. It affects my concentration at work - I have to ask people to repeat themselves because the ringing masks their voice.'\n\n**Describing Impact:**\n- 'The ringing wakes me up at night'\n- 'I can't concentrate in quiet rooms because all I hear is the ringing'\n- 'I've had to turn up the TV so loud it bothers my family'\n- 'I miss parts of conversations because I can't hear over the tinnitus'\n- 'It affects my mood - I get frustrated and irritable'",
    "common_mistakes": "## Common Mistakes\n\n**Mistake 1: Guessing During Audiometry**\nDon't raise your hand unless you actually hear a tone. Guessing makes your hearing appear better than it is, lowering your rating.\n\n**Mistake 2: Not Describing Tinnitus Impact**\nA simple 'yes, I have ringing' isn't enough. Describe:\n- How severe it is\n- How it affects sleep\n- How it affects concentration\n- How it affects work and relationships\n- How it affects mood\n\n**Mistake 3: Not Documenting Military Noise Exposure**\nService connection requires linking hearing loss/tinnitus to service. Document:\n- Your MOS and noise hazards\n- Specific loud events\n- Frequency of exposure\n- Hearing protection use (or lack thereof)\n\n**Mistake 4: Assuming Examiner Knows Your Job Involved Noise**\nDon't assume. Clearly explain what noise you were exposed to. Infantry, artillery, aviation, armor, and many other MOSs have documented noise exposure.\n\n**Mistake 5: Not Mentioning Both Conditions**\nIf you have both hearing loss AND tinnitus, make sure both are evaluated. They're rated separately.\n\n**Mistake 6: Exposure to Loud Noise Before Exam**\nAvoid loud noise (concerts, power tools, loud music) for at least 24 hours before. Temporary hearing changes can affect results.\n\n**Mistake 7: Minimizing Daily Impact**\nExplain how hearing problems affect your LIFE:\n- Work difficulties\n- Relationship strain\n- Social withdrawal\n- Sleep problems\n- Concentration issues",
    "after_exam": "## After the Exam\n\n**Immediately After:**\n- Document how the exam went\n- Note if the booth seemed noisy or equipment seemed faulty\n- Record if examiner asked about tinnitus impact\n- Write down your tinnitus description\n\n**Getting Your Results:**\n- Request audiogram through VA.gov\n- Review the numbers - they directly determine your hearing loss rating\n- Check that tinnitus was documented if you reported it\n\n**Understanding Your Audiogram:**\n- Numbers represent decibels (dB) at each frequency\n- Higher numbers = worse hearing\n- VA averages thresholds at 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hz\n- Combined with speech recognition for final rating\n\n**If Exam Seemed Inadequate:**\nContact your VSO or file a statement if:\n- Booth was noisy (not properly sound-treated)\n- Equipment seemed faulty\n- Examiner didn't ask about tinnitus when you reported it\n- Speech recognition test wasn't performed\n- Examiner didn't document noise exposure history\n\n**Timeline:**\n- Results typically processed within 1-2 weeks\n- Overall decision: 3-4 months after exam average\n- Decision letter sent by mail\n\n**If Denied or Rated Too Low:**\n- For tinnitus: Focus on service connection - proving noise exposure in service\n- For hearing loss: May need to show worsening over time or get private audiogram\n- Supplemental Claim with buddy statements about noise exposure\n- Higher-Level Review if evidence was ignored",
