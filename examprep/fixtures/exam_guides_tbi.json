    "introduction": "## Understanding the TBI C&P Exam\n\nTraumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is often called the 'signature injury' of recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Unlike a broken bone or visible wound, TBI symptoms are largely invisible - which makes this exam critically important for documenting what you experience daily.\n\n**Why TBI Claims Are Challenging:**\n- Symptoms are 'invisible' to others\n- Many veterans minimize cognitive problems\n- Symptoms overlap with PTSD and other conditions\n- You may not realize how much you've changed\n- Family members often see symptoms you don't notice\n\n**What You Need to Know:**\n- The VA uses TWO different TBI DBQ forms: Initial (first exam) and Review (subsequent exams)\n- TBI is rated on residual symptoms, not the injury itself\n- You can be rated for TBI AND secondary conditions (headaches, tinnitus, PTSD)\n- The exam evaluates THREE areas: cognitive, behavioral/emotional, and physical\n\n**Common TBI Causes in Service:**\n- IED blasts (even without direct impact)\n- Vehicle accidents/rollovers\n- Falls\n- Combat-related concussions\n- Training injuries\n- Parachute landing falls\n\n**Important:** If you had ANY head injury or blast exposure in service - even if you 'walked it off' - document it. Many veterans don't realize repeated 'minor' concussions cause lasting damage.",
    "what_exam_measures": "## What the TBI Exam Measures\n\nThe VA evaluates TBI based on RESIDUAL SYMPTOMS - the lasting effects of your brain injury. The exam assesses three main areas:\n\n### 1. Cognitive Impairment (Memory, Concentration, Executive Function)\n**What They Evaluate:**\n- Memory problems (short-term and long-term)\n- Concentration and attention difficulties\n- Processing speed (how fast you think)\n- Executive function (planning, organizing, decision-making)\n- Judgment and problem-solving\n\n**Rating Levels:**\n- **Level 0**: No impairment\n- **Level 1**: Mild impairment (complaints but objective testing normal)\n- **Level 2**: Moderate impairment (some objective evidence)\n- **Level 3**: Severe impairment (significant objective evidence)\n- **Level Total**: Complete impairment\n\n### 2. Behavioral/Emotional Symptoms\n**What They Evaluate:**\n- Irritability and mood swings\n- Anxiety and depression\n- Impulsivity\n- Aggression\n- Social inappropriateness\n- Apathy and lack of motivation\n\n### 3. Physical/Neurological Symptoms\n**What They Evaluate:**\n- Headaches (frequency, severity, duration)\n- Dizziness and balance problems\n- Vision changes\n- Light and noise sensitivity\n- Sleep disturbances\n- Fatigue\n- Seizures (if applicable)\n\n### How TBI is Rated\nYour rating is based on the HIGHEST level of impairment in any of the three areas:\n- **0%**: Diagnosed TBI with no residual symptoms\n- **10%**: Level 1 impairment in one or more areas\n- **40%**: Level 2 impairment in one or more areas\n- **70%**: Level 3 impairment in one or more areas\n- **100%**: Total impairment in one or more areas\n\n**Critical Point:** You can ALSO receive separate ratings for specific TBI residuals (like migraine headaches at 30-50%) on top of your TBI rating. Don't let the VA pyramid - you may be entitled to multiple ratings.",
    "physical_tests": "## Tests During the TBI Exam\n\nThe TBI C&P exam includes both cognitive testing and physical/neurological examination.\n\n### Cognitive Testing\n**You may be given:**\n- Memory tests (repeating words, recalling lists)\n- Attention tests (counting backwards, serial 7s)\n- Processing speed tests\n- Executive function assessments\n- Trail-making tests (connecting dots in sequence)\n\n**Critical Warning:** These tests measure your performance ON THAT DAY. If you're having a 'good day,' your results may not reflect your typical functioning. TELL THE EXAMINER about your bad days.\n\n### Neurological Examination\n**The examiner may test:**\n- Balance and coordination (standing with eyes closed, walking heel-to-toe)\n- Reflexes\n- Eye movements and tracking\n- Cranial nerve function\n- Sensory examination\n- Motor strength\n\n### Questions About Daily Functioning\n**They will ask about:**\n- Do you get lost in familiar places?\n- Do you forget appointments, conversations, tasks?\n- Can you follow multi-step instructions?\n- Do you have trouble finding words?\n- Can you manage finances, medications, schedules?\n- How many hours can you concentrate?\n- Do you need reminders for daily tasks?\n\n### What Family Members Observe\n**Consider having a family member write a statement about:**\n- Personality changes since injury\n- Memory problems they've noticed\n- Things you repeat or forget\n- Mood/anger changes\n- Times you've gotten lost or confused\n- How you've changed since before the injury",
    "questions_to_expect": "## Questions to Expect\n\n### About the Initial Injury\n- When did the injury occur?\n- What happened?

    "preparation_tips": "## Preparation Tips\n\n### 2 Weeks Before\n- **Find the TBI DBQ**: Search 'VA TBI DBQ' or look for VA Form 21-0960C-1 (Initial) or 21-0960C-2 (Review)\n- **Gather evidence of in-service injury**: Service treatment records, buddy statements, incident reports\n- **Request your medical records**: Get any post-service treatment records for TBI or related symptoms\n\n### 1 Week Before\n- **Create a symptom log with SPECIFIC examples:**\n\n**Cognitive Examples:**\n- 'I forgot my wife's birthday - we've been married 15 years'\n- 'I got lost driving to the grocery store I've gone to for 5 years'\n- 'I can't remember conversations from yesterday'\n- 'I have to read pages multiple times to understand'\n- 'I can't follow multi-step instructions at work'\n\n**Behavioral Examples:**\n- 'I had 3 angry outbursts this week over minor things'\n- 'My wife says I've become a different person'\n- 'I used to be patient - now everything irritates me'\n- 'I made impulsive purchases totaling $X this month'\n\n**Physical Examples:**\n- 'I have headaches 4-5 days per week, lasting 4-6 hours'\n- 'I can't be in bright stores - have to wear sunglasses inside'\n- 'I lose my balance in the shower'\n- 'Loud noises give me instant headaches'\n\n### Ask Family Members\n**Have a spouse, parent, or close friend write a statement answering:**\n- How has [veteran] changed since the injury?\n- What memory problems have you observed?\n- What behavioral changes have you noticed?\n- What can't they do now that they could before?\n- Specific examples of incidents\n\n### Day Before\n- Review your symptom log\n- Gather documents to bring\n- Don't over-prepare or exhaust yourself\n- Get normal sleep (don't try to be extra rested)\n\n### What to Bring\n- Written symptom log with specific examples\n- Family member statements\n- List of all medications\n- Documentation of in-service incidents\n- Any recent medical records or imaging",
    "day_of_guidance": "## Day-of Guidance\n\n### The Biggest TBI Exam Mistake\n**Compensating and appearing 'normal'** - Your brain has learned workarounds for your deficits. You use alarms, lists, GPS, and family help to function. During the exam, these compensations make you appear higher-functioning than you actually are.\n\n**Be honest about your RAW deficits - what happens when systems fail:**\n- 'Without my phone reminders, I miss every appointment'\n- 'Without GPS, I get lost going to familiar places'\n- 'Without my wife reminding me, I forget to eat'\n- 'Without lists, I can't complete simple tasks'\n\n### Critical DOs\n- **DO describe your WORST days**, not your average or good days\n- **DO bring your symptom log** and reference it openly\n- **DO explain compensations**: 'I can only function because...'\n- **DO describe specific incidents** of memory failure, getting lost, etc.\n- **DO mention ALL symptoms** - headaches, dizziness, light sensitivity, sleep problems\n- **DO tell them about cognitive tests you've failed** - work assessments, driving tests\n- **DO ask for breaks if you need them** - fatigue is a symptom\n\n### Critical DON'Ts\n- **DON'T pretend you're fine** - military culture of 'walking it off' hurts your claim\n- **DON'T compensate during cognitive tests** - if you can't remember, say so\n- **DON'T hide the accommodations you use daily**\n- **DON'T compare yourself to your worst-injured buddy** - 'At least I'm not like...' minimizes your injury\n- **DON'T over-prepare** - being too polished suggests better function than reality\n\n### Communication Examples\n\n**Instead of:** 'My memory is okay, I just use my phone a lot'\n**Say:** 'Without my phone, I cannot function. I have 15 alarms set daily. I still forget things. Last week I forgot to pick up my kids. Before the injury, I never needed reminders for anything.'\n\n**Instead of:** 'I get headaches sometimes'\n**Say:** 'I have headaches 5 days per week. They're throbbing, 7/10 severity, and last 4-6 hours. Bright lights and loud noises make them worse. I have to lie down in a dark room. I've missed work 3 times this month because of them.'\n\n**Instead of:** 'I'm doing okay'\n**Say:** 'I'm surviving, but I'm not the same person. My wife handles all our finances now because I made mistakes. I had to quit my job. I can't remember conversations from yesterday. I get lost driving to places I've been to a hundred times.'",
    "common_mistakes": "## Common Mistakes\n\n### Mistake 1: Appearing Too 'Together'\nYou've developed workarounds to function. Using lists, alarms, and family support is survival - but it masks your deficits. Tell the examiner what happens when these systems fail.\n\n### Mistake 2: Minimizing the Injury\n'It was just a concussion' or 'I didn't lose consciousness' or 'Others had it worse' - these statements hurt you. Even 'mild' TBI causes lasting damage. Multiple subconcussive impacts (blasts, hits) cause cumulative injury.\n\n### Mistake 3: Not Mentioning All Incidents\nMany veterans had MULTIPLE head injuries or blast exposures. Document ALL of them, not just the worst one. Cumulative damage matters.\n\n### Mistake 4: Forgetting Secondary Conditions\nTBI often causes conditions that deserve SEPARATE ratings:\n- Migraine headaches (up to 50%)\n- Tinnitus (10%)\n- Vestibular/balance disorders (up to 100%)\n- Sleep disorders\n- Depression/anxiety\n- Cognitive disorder\n\nDon't let the VA roll everything into one TBI rating if you qualify for multiple ratings.\n\n### Mistake 5: Performing Well on Testing\nCognitive tests measure ONE moment in time. If you're having a good day, tell the examiner: 'Today is a good day. On bad days, I can't even...'\n\n### Mistake 6: Not Having Family Statements\nYou may not realize how much you've changed. Family members see what you can't. Their statements are powerful evidence.\n\n### Mistake 7: Comparing to Pre-Injury Self Only\nDescribe what you CAN'T do now:\n- 'I can't work the job I trained for'\n- 'I can't help my kids with homework'\n- 'I can't follow conversations'\n- 'I can't manage household responsibilities'\n\n### Mistake 8: Not Mentioning Sleep and Fatigue\nCognitive fatigue is a hallmark TBI symptom. If you need naps, can only focus for limited periods, or are exhausted by mental tasks - say so.\n\n### Mistake 9: Hiding Treatment or Therapy\nIf you're in cognitive rehabilitation, speech therapy, or taking medications for TBI symptoms - this is EVIDENCE of severity, not weakness. Document it.",
    "after_exam": "## After the Exam\n\n### Immediately After\n- **Write down everything** while it's fresh:\n  - Questions asked and your answers\n  - Tests performed and how you think you did\n  - How long the exam lasted\n  - Whether the examiner seemed thorough\n  - Anything that felt incomplete\n\n### Getting Your Results\n- Request a copy of the exam report through VA.gov or eBenefits\n- Review it carefully for accuracy\n\n**Check that the examiner documented:**\n- All three areas (cognitive, behavioral, physical)\n- Specific symptoms you reported\n- Severity levels you described\n- Impact on daily functioning\n- Your worst days, not just exam-day performance\n\n### Signs of an Inadequate Exam\n- Exam lasted less than 30 minutes\n- Examiner didn't ask about all three symptom areas\n- Examiner didn't perform cognitive testing\n- Examiner didn't ask about functional impact\n- Your reported symptoms aren't in the report\n- Conclusions don't match what you described\n\n### If the Exam Was Inadequate\n- Contact your VSO immediately\n- File a statement describing deficiencies BEFORE the rating decision\n- Request a new examination with a different examiner\n- Consider getting a private neuropsychological evaluation\n\n### Secondary Claims to Consider\nAfter your TBI rating, consider separate claims for:\n- **Migraine headaches** (if frequent and severe)\n- **Tinnitus** (ringing in ears from blast exposure)\n- **Balance/vestibular disorder** (if you have dizziness)\n- **Sleep apnea** (common with TBI)\n- **Depression or anxiety** (if not already claimed)\n- **Erectile dysfunction** (common with TBI)\n\n### Timeline\n- Exam results typically reach rating specialist in 1-2 weeks\n- Overall decision: 3-4 months on average\n- You'll receive a decision letter by mail\n\n### If You Disagree With Your Rating\n- **Supplemental Claim**: Submit new evidence (neuropsych eval, family statements)\n- **Higher-Level Review**: If VA made an error\n- **Board Appeal**: For complex cases\n\n### Support Resources\n- **Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center (DVBIC)**: 1-800-870-9244\n- **Polytrauma System of Care**: Ask your VA for referral\n- **Veterans Crisis Line**: 988 (Press 1)",
