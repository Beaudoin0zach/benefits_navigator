Secondary Conditions Data and Service

This module provides comprehensive data about secondary service connection relationships
between VA-recognized conditions. Secondary conditions are disabilities caused or
aggravated by an already service-connected condition.

Reference: 38 CFR 3.310 - Disabilities that are proximately due to, or aggravated by,
service-connected disease or injury.
