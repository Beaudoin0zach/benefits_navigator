The examiner will ask detailed questions about your traumatic experiences, current symptoms, and how PTSD affects your daily life.\n\nThe exam consists of:\n1. Review of your military and medical records\n2. Discussion of your stressor events (the traumatic experiences)\n3. Assessment of your current symptoms using standardized criteria\n4. Evaluation of how symptoms impact work, relationships, and daily activities\n5. Possible psychological testing (questionnaires)",
      "key_questions": ["Can you describe the traumatic event(s) you experienced?", "When did you first notice symptoms after the event?", "How often do you have nightmares or flashbacks?", "Do you avoid certain places, people, or situations that remind you of the trauma?", "How has your sleep been affected?", "Do you experience hypervigilance or an exaggerated startle response?", "How do your symptoms affect your work performance?", "How have your relationships been impacted?", "Do you have thoughts of self-harm or suicide?", "What treatments have you tried, and how effective were they?"],

      "how_to_prepare": "Before your exam:\n\n1. **Review your stressor statement** - Be prepared to discuss the traumatic events in detail. You don't need to relive every moment, but the examiner needs specifics.\n\n2. **Document your symptoms** - Keep a log of nightmares, flashbacks, panic attacks, and avoidance behaviors for 2-4 weeks before the exam.\n\n3. **Note your worst days** - VA rates based on your overall condition, not your best days. Be honest about your worst symptoms.\n\n4. **Prepare examples** - Think of specific examples of how PTSD affects your work, relationships, and daily activities.\n\n5. **Bring support** - You can bring a family member or friend who can describe how your symptoms affect you.\n\n6. **Get adequate sleep** - Being well-rested helps you communicate clearly, but don't downplay sleep problems you actually have.",
      "tips": "- Be completely honest about your symptoms - don't minimize or exaggerate\n- Describe your WORST days, not your best days\n- If you don't remember something, say so - don't guess\n- Take breaks if you need them - it's okay to ask for a pause\n- Bring a written list of symptoms if you're worried about forgetting\n- If the examiner asks about suicidal thoughts, be honest - this is confidential and helps determine severity\n- Mention ALL symptoms, even ones you think are minor\n- Describe how symptoms affect your JOB specifically - missed work, conflicts, difficulty concentrating\n- Don't be afraid to show emotion - this is expected when discussing trauma",
