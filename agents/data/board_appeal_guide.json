  "when_to_use": "File a Board Appeal when you want a Veterans Law Judge to review your case. This is the right choice when:\n\n- You want to present your case in person at a hearing\n- Your case is complex and needs a judge's interpretation\n- You've already tried Supplemental Claims and/or Higher-Level Review\n- You have strong evidence but the regional office keeps denying you\n- You want the highest level of review within the VA system\n\nThe Board of Veterans' Appeals is separate from the regional offices. Veterans Law Judges often see cases differently than rating specialists.",

  "when_not_to_use": "Consider other options first if:\n\n- You have new evidence and want faster processing (Supplemental Claim is faster)\n- You believe VA made a clear error (Higher-Level Review is faster)\n- Time is critical - Board Appeals take 1-2+ years\n- Your case is straightforward and doesn't need a judge\n\nBoard Appeals are powerful but slow. If a Supplemental Claim or Higher-Level Review can solve your issue, try those first.",

  "overview": "The Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA) is the VA's 'court' where Veterans Law Judges review appeals. It's located in Washington, D.C., but you don't have to travel there.\n\nBoard Appeals take longer than other options (typically 1-2+ years), but they offer something others don't: the chance to present your case to a judge, either in person, by video, or in writing.\n\n**Three Lanes (Choose One):**\n\n1. **Direct Review** - Judge reviews your file, no new evidence, no hearing. Fastest Board option (~400 days).\n\n2. **Evidence Submission** - You can submit new evidence for 90 days, then judge reviews. No hearing. (~550 days)\n\n3. **Hearing Request** - You present your case to a judge (in person, video, or virtual). Can submit evidence at hearing. Longest wait (~850 days).\n\nBoard decisions carry more weight than regional office decisions and can only be overturned by federal courts.",

  "requirements": "To file a Board Appeal, you need:\n\n**Required:**\n- VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal)\n- Filed within 1 year of your decision date\n- Choose one of three lanes (Direct, Evidence, or Hearing)\n\n**For Evidence Submission Lane:**\n- Any new evidence must be submitted within 90 days of filing\n\n**For Hearing Lane:**\n- Indicate hearing type preference: In-person, Video, or Virtual/Tele-hearing\n- In-person hearings are at VA regional offices or Washington, D.C.\n\n**Optional but Helpful:**\n- Written statement explaining why you disagree\n- Representative (VSO, attorney, or claims agent)",

  "step_by_step": "**Step 1: Choose Your Lane**\n\n**Direct Review** - Choose if:\n- You have no new evidence\n- You don't want/need a hearing\n- You want the fastest Board option\n\n**Evidence Submission** - Choose if:\n- You have or will obtain new evidence\n- You don't want a hearing\n- You can submit evidence within 90 days\n\n**Hearing Request** - Choose if:\n- You want to present your case to a judge\n- You have a complex case that benefits from explanation\n- You're willing to wait longer for the hearing\n\n**Step 2: Complete VA Form 10182**\n- Select your lane (only pick ONE)\n- List all issues you're appealing\n- If requesting hearing, indicate type preference\n- Sign and date\n\n**Step 3: Submit the Form**\n- Online at VA.gov\n- By mail to Board of Veterans' Appeals\n- Through your VSO or representative\n\n**Step 4: If Evidence Lane - Submit Evidence**\nYou have 90 days from filing to submit new evidence. Submit everything within this window.\n\n**Step 5: If Hearing Lane - Prepare for Hearing**\n- You'll receive a hearing notice\n- Prepare your testimony and evidence\n- Consider having a representative\n\n**Step 6: Wait for Decision**\nThe judge will review your case and issue a decision. You'll receive it by mail.",

  "evidence_guidance": "**Evidence Rules by Lane:**\n\n**Direct Review Lane:**\n- NO new evidence allowed\n- Judge only reviews what's already in your file\n- Similar to Higher-Level Review but by a judge\n\n**Evidence Submission Lane:**\n- NEW evidence IS allowed\n- Must submit within 90 days of filing VA Form 10182\n- After 90 days, the window closes\n- Submit strong evidence: nexus letters, medical records, buddy statements\n\n**Hearing Lane:**\n- Can submit evidence at the hearing\n- Can also submit within 90 days after the hearing\n- Testimony itself is considered evidence\n- Bring copies of key documents to reference\n\n**What Makes Strong Evidence for the Board:**\n- Clear nexus letters with 'at least as likely as not' language\n- Specific buddy statements with dates and details\n- Medical records showing current diagnosis and treatment\n- Expert opinions addressing the specific issues\n- Any evidence directly addressing why regional office denied you",

  "common_mistakes": "**Mistake 1: Choosing the Wrong Lane**\nOnce you pick a lane, you're locked in for that appeal. Choose carefully:\n- Have new evidence? → Evidence or Hearing lane\n- Want to explain your case? → Hearing lane\n- Just want a fresh review? → Direct lane\n\n**Mistake 2: Missing the 90-Day Evidence Window**\nIn the Evidence Submission lane, you have exactly 90 days to submit new evidence. After that, the window closes permanently for this appeal.\n\n**Mistake 3: Not Preparing for the Hearing**\nA hearing is your chance to tell your story directly to a judge. Don't wing it:\n- Prepare your key points\n- Have evidence organized\n- Practice explaining your case clearly\n\n**Mistake 4: Not Understanding Wait Times**\nBoard Appeals take 1-2+ years. If you need faster resolution, consider Supplemental Claim or Higher-Level Review first.\n\n**Mistake 5: Skipping Representation**\nBoard hearings benefit from having a representative (VSO, attorney, or claims agent). They know the process and can help present your case effectively.\n\n**Mistake 6: Missing the Hearing**\nIf you request a hearing and miss it without good cause, your appeal may be decided without one. Keep your contact info updated and respond to all notices.\n\n**Mistake 7: Not Appealing All Issues**\nList every issue you want the judge to review on your form. Issues not listed won't be considered.",

  "after_submission": "**What Happens After Filing:**\n\n**Month 1-2: Acknowledgment**\nBoard acknowledges receipt. You're placed in the queue for your chosen lane.\n\n**Direct Review Lane (~400 days):**\n- Your file goes to a judge for review\n- No additional steps from you\n- Decision mailed when complete\n\n**Evidence Submission Lane (~550 days):**\n- 90-day window to submit evidence\n- After window closes, file goes to judge\n- Decision mailed when complete\n\n**Hearing Lane (~850 days):**\n- Wait for hearing to be scheduled (can take 1+ year)\n- Receive hearing notice 60 days before\n- Attend hearing (in-person, video, or virtual)\n- 90-day window after hearing to submit evidence\n- Decision mailed after judge reviews\n\n**Possible Outcomes:**\n\n- **Granted:** Judge rules in your favor. Regional office implements the decision.\n\n- **Remanded:** Judge finds errors and sends case back for correction. Often leads to approval.\n\n- **Denied:** Judge upholds the denial. Options: Request reconsideration, appeal to U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC).\n\n**Remand Is Common:**\nMany Board cases result in remand. This isn't a loss - it means the judge found problems. The regional office must address them, often resulting in approval.",

  "tips": "**Pro Tips for Board Appeals:**\n\n1. **Choose Your Lane Wisely**\nDirect is fastest but no new evidence. Evidence lane gives 90 days. Hearing is slowest but most personal. Match the lane to your situation.\n\n2. **Get a Representative for Hearings**\nVSOs, attorneys, and claims agents can represent you for free or reasonable fees. They know how to present cases to judges.\n\n3. **Prepare Thoroughly for Hearings**\nWrite out your key points. Practice explaining your case. Organize your evidence. The judge only has a short time - make it count.\n\n4. **Be Honest and Specific**\nJudges appreciate honesty. Don't exaggerate, but don't minimize either. Specific details (dates, symptoms, impacts) are more persuasive than generalities.\n\n5. **Don't Repeat the Same Failed Arguments**\nIf previous appeals failed because of missing evidence, submit that evidence (Evidence or Hearing lane). Don't just reargue the same points.\n\n6. **Keep Contact Info Updated**\nMissing a hearing notice because of old address can derail your appeal. Update VA whenever you move.\n\n7. **Understand the Timeline**\nBoard Appeals take years. If you need faster resolution, try other options first. Board is often the final option within VA.\n\n8. **Remand Can Be Good**\nA remand means the judge found something wrong. It goes back for correction and often results in approval. Don't be discouraged by remand.\n\n9. **Consider Partial Appeals**\nYou can appeal some issues to the Board while pursuing others through Supplemental Claims. Strategic use of lanes can speed things up.",
