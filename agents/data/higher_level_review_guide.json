  "when_to_use": "File a Higher-Level Review when you believe the VA made an ERROR with the evidence they already had.\n\nGood situations for Higher-Level Review:\n- The VA ignored evidence in your file (like a nexus letter)\n- The rating specialist miscalculated your combined rating\n- The VA used the wrong diagnostic code for your condition\n- Your C&P exam results were misinterpreted\n- The VA didn't apply the 'benefit of the doubt' rule\n- The examiner's findings weren't reflected in the decision\n- The VA ordered an unnecessary exam for a presumptive condition\n\nThe key: You're NOT submitting new evidence. You're asking a senior reviewer to look at the SAME evidence with fresh eyes.",

  "when_not_to_use": "Do NOT file a Higher-Level Review if:\n\n- You have new evidence to submit (use Supplemental Claim instead)\n- Your case needs new evidence to win (HLR won't help without it)\n- You want to present your case in person with new evidence (use Board Appeal)\n- You already filed an HLR for this decision (can only file one per decision)\n\nHigher-Level Review is ONLY for correcting errors. If your claim was denied because you're missing evidence (like a nexus letter), getting that evidence and filing a Supplemental Claim is better.",

  "overview": "A Higher-Level Review asks a more senior VA employee to take a fresh look at your claim using the SAME evidence that was already in your file. No new evidence is allowed.\n\nThis is the best option when you believe the VA made a mistake - maybe they ignored a medical opinion, used the wrong rating criteria, or made a calculation error.\n\nThe average processing time is about 141 days. If the reviewer finds an error, they can either correct it themselves or return your claim (called a 'remand') for additional work.\n\n**Important:** You can only file ONE Higher-Level Review per decision. If it's denied, your options are Supplemental Claim (with new evidence) or Board Appeal.",

  "requirements": "To file a Higher-Level Review, you need:\n\n**Required:**\n- VA Form 20-0996 (Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review)\n- Filed within 1 year of your decision date\n\n**Optional but Recommended:**\n- Request an Informal Conference (phone call with the reviewer)\n- Written statement identifying the specific error(s)\n\n**What You CANNOT Include:**\n- New evidence\n- New medical records\n- New nexus letters\n- New buddy statements\n\nIf you try to submit new evidence with an HLR, it will NOT be considered. The reviewer only looks at what was already in your file.",

  "step_by_step": "**Step 1: Identify the Error**\nReview your decision letter and claim file. What did the VA get wrong? Be specific:\n- Did they ignore a document?\n- Did they misapply a regulation?\n- Did they make a math error?\n- Did they use wrong criteria?\n\n**Step 2: Complete VA Form 20-0996**\nFill out the form:\n- Check 'Higher-Level Review'\n- List the issues/conditions you're appealing\n- Request an Informal Conference (recommended)\n- Note the same office or different office preference\n\n**Step 3: Prepare for Informal Conference (if requested)**\nThis is your chance to talk to the reviewer:\n- Prepare talking points about the specific errors\n- Have your decision letter ready\n- Be ready to point to specific evidence in your file\n- Be concise and factual\n\n**Step 4: Submit the Form**\nSubmit VA Form 20-0996:\n- Online at VA.gov\n- By mail to your regional office\n- In person\n- Through your VSO\n\n**Step 5: Wait for Conference Call**\nIf you requested an Informal Conference, you'll get a call. This usually happens within 30-60 days of filing.\n\n**Step 6: Wait for Decision**\nAfter the review (and conference if requested), the reviewer will issue a decision. Average time: ~141 days.",

  "evidence_guidance": "**Remember: No New Evidence Allowed**\n\nWith a Higher-Level Review, you're asking the VA to re-examine evidence that's ALREADY in your file. The reviewer will look at:\n\n**What's Already in Your File:**\n- Your original claim and all submissions\n- Service treatment records\n- VA medical records\n- Private medical records you submitted\n- C&P exam reports\n- Any nexus letters or opinions\n- Buddy statements\n- Previous rating decisions\n\n**Your Job Is To Point Out Errors:**\nInstead of gathering new evidence, document the specific errors:\n- 'The decision ignored the nexus letter from Dr. Smith dated 5/15/2024'\n- 'The rating used 38 CFR 4.71a instead of the correct 4.73'\n- 'The C&P exam noted pain at 30 degrees but the decision said full ROM'\n\n**If You Need New Evidence:**\nIf you realize your file is missing key evidence, STOP. File a Supplemental Claim instead. An HLR without the right evidence in your file will fail.",

  "common_mistakes": "**Mistake 1: Filing HLR When You Need New Evidence**\nIf your claim was denied because you're missing a nexus letter, HLR won't help. You need to GET the nexus letter and file a Supplemental Claim.\n\n**Mistake 2: Not Requesting an Informal Conference**\nThe Informal Conference is free and gives you a chance to explain the error directly to the reviewer. Always request it unless you have a good reason not to.\n\n**Mistake 3: Being Vague About the Error**\nDon't just say 'I disagree.' Identify the SPECIFIC error: what document, what date, what regulation, what calculation.\n\n**Mistake 4: Trying to Submit New Evidence**\nAny new evidence you include will be ignored. If you have new evidence, file a Supplemental Claim instead.\n\n**Mistake 5: Missing the Informal Conference Call**\nIf you requested a conference, ANSWER THE PHONE. If you miss it, you may not get another chance. Make sure VA has your correct phone number.\n\n**Mistake 6: Filing Multiple HLRs**\nYou can only file ONE Higher-Level Review per decision. If it fails, your options are Supplemental Claim or Board Appeal.\n\n**Mistake 7: Not Reviewing Your Complete File**\nRequest your complete claim file (C-File) before filing. You need to know exactly what's in there to identify errors.",

  "after_submission": "**What Happens After You Submit:**\n\n**Week 1-4: Claim Received**\nVA acknowledges receipt. If you requested an Informal Conference, you're added to the queue.\n\n**Week 4-8: Informal Conference (if requested)**\nA reviewer will call you. This is your chance to:\n- Explain the error clearly\n- Point to specific evidence in your file\n- Ask questions\n\nThe call usually lasts 15-30 minutes. Be prepared and concise.\n\n**Week 8-20: Senior Review**\nThe Higher-Level Reviewer examines your file with fresh eyes, looking for the errors you identified.\n\n**Average Timeline: ~141 days**\n\n**Possible Outcomes:**\n\n- **Granted:** The reviewer found an error in your favor. You'll get a new rating.\n\n- **Remanded:** The reviewer found problems but can't fix them directly. Your claim goes back for additional work (like a new C&P exam). This is often positive.\n\n- **Denied:** The reviewer found no error. You can:\n  - File a Supplemental Claim with new evidence\n  - Appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals\n\n**Note:** A remand isn't a denial - it often leads to approval after the additional work is done.",

  "tips": "**Pro Tips for Higher-Level Review:**\n\n1. **Always Request the Informal Conference**\nThis is your chance to speak directly with the decision-maker. Use it. Come prepared with specific points.\n\n2. **Get Your C-File First**\nRequest your complete claim file before filing. You can't argue about errors if you don't know what's in your file.\n\n3. **Be Specific About Errors**\nGeneral complaints don't work. Point to specific documents, dates, and regulations. 'The decision on page 3 ignored the DBQ finding of painful motion at 30 degrees' is effective.\n\n4. **Use a VSO**\nVSOs can help identify errors you might miss. They know the regulations and can spot mistakes in how your claim was processed.\n\n5. **Prepare for the Conference Call**\nWrite down your points beforehand. Have your decision letter and notes ready. Be respectful but firm about the errors.\n\n6. **Know When HLR Isn't Right**\nIf the problem is missing evidence (not an error with existing evidence), file a Supplemental Claim instead. HLR can't add what isn't there.\n\n7. **Keep the Call Professional**\nThe reviewer wants to help, but they can only work with what's in your file. Stay calm, be factual, and focus on the specific errors.\n\n8. **Understand Remand**\nA remand isn't a loss - it means the reviewer found something wrong. The additional work often leads to approval.",
