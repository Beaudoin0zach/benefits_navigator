              "content": "38 CFR 3.151(a) instructs that a claim for compensation may be accepted as a claim for Veterans Pension and vice versa.  Application of this provision of 38 CFR 3.151(a) is discretionary.  Not all claims for Veterans Pension are necessarily claims for compensation and vice versa.\nConsider the following three criteria when deciding whether VA will make the discretionary decision to apply 38 CFR 3.151(a) in the context of the Standard Claims and Appeals Forms rule.\nRegardless of which claims form is submitted, the information on the claim must constitute a substantially complete claim for the unclaimed benefit being considered under 38 CFR 3.151(a).\nIf VA Form 21P-527EZ is accepted as a claim for compensation, the claim form must include information that would otherwise be included on a claim for compensation.\nIf VA Form 21-526EZ is accepted as a claim for Veterans Pension, the claim form must include information that would otherwise be included on a claim for Veterans Pension including income information.\nThe evidence of record must establish a likelihood that the benefit will be granted.\nThe claim must be reasonably interpreted to reflect an intent to claim benefits for the issue at hand.  Generally, this is reflected via the claimant listing the issue on the claim form.\nImportant:  If all of the above criteria are not met, then the discretionary application of 38 CFR 3.151(a) is not warranted.  In situations where the\ndiscretionary application of 38 CFR 3.151(a) is not warranted and the claimant has submitted an improper form for application for a benefit, follow the request for application procedures at M21-1, Part II, Subpart iii, 2.G.1, or\nevidence shows the presence of a chronic, unclaimed disability but the claimant has not expressed an intent to claim a benefit, solicit a claim per M21-1, Part II, Subpart iii, 2.G.2.\nNote:  For DIC and Survivors Pension, the claims provisions are not discretionary.\nReferences:  For more information on\nthe discretionary application of 38 CFR 3.151(a), see Stewart v.

              "content": "VA Form 21-2680, can be used as a standalone form if the claimant and/or the supporting documentation identifies whether the benefit sought is SMP (only when there is a running pension award) or SMC.  Revisions to the form (effective September 2018) allow the claimant to identify the benefit sought.\nThe identification of the benefit sought can be\nspecific, with the Veteran identifying on the form whether the claim is for SMC or SMP, or\nbased on sympathetic reading of the claim via reviewing the issues raised on VA Form 21-2680 in the context of the benefits the Veteran is receiving.\nWhen VA Form 21-2680 is submitted, the Veteran is identified as the claimant, and the benefit sought is\nnot identified, determine the benefit sought and next action by applying the principles in the table below, or\nidentified, and is a claim for\nSMC\nif a prior original claim for compensation is of record (whether granted or denied), accept the claim for SMC and issue a decision based on the evidence of record, or\nif no prior original claim for compensation is of record, consider the VA Form 21-2680 a request for application, and/or\nif the evidence of record suggests that pension with SMP may be payable as a greater benefit, then alsoapply the principles in the table below that correspond with the SMP claim and the Veteran’s benefit status to determine the appropriate next action to take.\nSMP, apply the principles in the table below that correspond with the SMP claim and the Veteran’s benefit status to determine the appropriate next action to take.\nNote:  Although VA Form 21-2680 may be accepted as a prescribed claim form for SMC or SMP, it is not required to grant entitlement to either benefit.  Do not undertake routine development for completion of this form when deciding a claim for SMC or SMP.  For more information on use of VA Form 21-2680, see M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 4.A.1.i.\nUse the table below to determine the benefits being sought by reviewing the Veteran's benefit status and VA Form 21-2680.\nIf ...\nThen accept the VA Form 21-2680 as ...\nthe Veteran is\nreceiving compensation\nentitled to receive compensation but has elected to receive military retired pay, or\nsubmitting any initial claim for compensation\na claim for SMC regardless of the conditions listed on the VA Form 21-2680.\nException:  If the

is in receipt of compensation, or\nSMP if in receipt of pension.\nImportant:  In addition to accepting the VA Form 21-2680 as a claim for SMC or SMP based on the benefit currently being received (as directed above), also accept the VA Form 21-2680 as a\nclaim for the opposite benefit (the benefit the Veteran is not currently in receipt of) only ifthe opposite benefit can be granted and the grant results in a greater benefit to the Veteran, or\nrequest for application if the Veteran is currently receiving compensation and the evidence suggests that pension may be the greater benefit but no

21-2680 is not required for the supplemental claim.\nWhen a prior claim for SMC or SMP has been denied but VA Form 21-2680 is not accompanied by VA Form 20-0995, then accept the submission of VA Form 21-2680 as an initial claim for\nSMC, or\nSMP only if there is a running award or pending pension claim, and\nfollow the applicable procedure based on corresponding claim status or benefit entitlement as directed in the remaining guidance in this table.\nthe Veteran is already in receipt of A&A for compensation\na request for application.\nReference:  For more information on handling a request for application, see M21-1, Part II, Subpart iii, 2.G.\nthe Veteran is already in receipt of A&A for pension\na duplicate request for SMP, unless following the above procedures within this table allows for acceptance of the VA Form 21-2680 as a claim for SMC.\nNote:  If the claim is accepted as a duplicate request for SMP, provide notice that the claimed benefit has previously been awarded.\nReminder:  When accepting VA Form 21-2680 as a claim for SMC or SMP, the form is a potential claim for both A&A and housebound benefits.\nA grant of A&A renders the issue of housebound moot for the same type of benefit (either SMC or SMP) since A&A is the greater benefit.  The issue of entitlement to SMC or SMP based on housebound status need not be addressed when A&A is granted for the same type of benefit (SMC or SMP).\nVA Form 21-2680 is a claim for both A&A and housebound benefits.  If A&A is denied, the rating decision must address the issue of housebound status.  If, however, housebound has been previously granted, the issue of entitlement to housebound need not be readdressed and/or continued in the rating decision.\nReferences:  For more information on\nreviewing VA Form
