    "Document ALL head injuries and blast exposures in service, even 'minor' ones",

    "Have family members write statements about changes they've observed",
    "Don't appear too 'put together' - this masks your actual deficits",
    "Mention cognitive fatigue and how long you can concentrate",
    "Document headache frequency, severity, and duration specifically",

    "Performing well on cognitive tests on a 'good day'",
    "Not claiming secondary conditions separately",
    "Forgetting to mention sleep, fatigue, and light/noise sensitivity",
    "Not explaining functional impact on work and daily life"
