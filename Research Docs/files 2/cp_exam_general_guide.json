        "overview": "A C&P (Compensation and Pension) exam is a medical evaluation that helps the VA understand how your condition affects you today. Think of it as a snapshot of your current health that connects back to your military service.",

          {
            "question": "Who does the exam?",
            "answer": "About 93% of C&P exams are done by contract companies like VES (Veterans Evaluation Services), LHI, or QTC—not VA doctors. Your examiner might be a doctor, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant. They're trained to evaluate veterans, but they may not specialize in your specific condition."
          },
          {
            "question": "How long does it take?",
            "answer": "Most exams last 15 to 30 minutes. Some complex conditions or multiple claims may take longer. The exam feels short because the examiner has a specific checklist to complete."
          },
          {
            "question": "Why does this matter?",
            "answer": "Your C&P exam is one of the most important steps in your claim. The examiner fills out a form that rating specialists use to decide your disability percentage. A thorough exam can mean the difference between a 10% rating and a 70% rating—and thousands of dollars in benefits."
