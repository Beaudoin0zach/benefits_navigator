        "overview": "A PTSD C&P exam is different from other disability exams. There are no X-rays, no blood tests, and no physical measurements. Instead, you'll have a conversation with a mental health professional about your experiences and how they affect your life today.",
        "acknowledgments": {
          "difficulty": "We know this is hard. Talking about trauma isn't easy. Many veterans have spent years trying NOT to think about certain things, and now you're being asked to discuss them with a stranger. That takes real courage.",
          "stigma": "Mental health stigma is real. The military taught you to be strong, to push through, to never show weakness. But seeking help for PTSD isn't weakness—it's taking care of an injury you received in service, just like any physical wound.",
          "reassurance": "It's okay to not be okay. This exam is your opportunity to show the real impact of what you've been through. You don't have to be 'fixed' or 'better' to deserve benefits. You just have to be honest."
        },
        "what_exam_determines": "The examiner evaluates how severe your PTSD symptoms are and how much they interfere with your work and daily life. This determines your disability rating, which can range from 0% to 100%."
