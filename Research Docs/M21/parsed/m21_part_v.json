This means deciding to which extent those items of evidence are relevant in tending to make the matter more probable or less probable.\nDiscuss and apply VA guidance (including court precedents) on competency to determine whether the evidence from a particular source can establish a particular fact that requires the application of special expertise or first-hand knowledge of facts based on recollection or perception. Evidence from a source not having the requisite competency to offer a particular type of evidence has no probative value.\nDiscuss and apply VA guidance on credibility where there is a reasonable factual basis (for example, demonstrable bias or inconsistency) for questioning believability. Evidence that is not believable does not have probative value.\n4\nResolve questions of relative weight or persuasiveness when there are various items of evidence that have been determined to have probative value in order to find facts (to determine what facts the evidence proves).\nNote:  It is important to explain why certain evidence was accepted as more probative than other evidence, especially when giving less value to evidence tending to support the benefit sought by the claimant/beneficiary.\n5\nApply the found facts to draw corresponding conclusions of law necessary to support the decision outcome for the benefit sought and procedural issue. Clearly explain in the rating decision why the evidence is found to be persuasive or unpersuasive.\nReference:  For more information on documenting unmet elements and favorable findings in a rating decision, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iv, 1.A.5.\nReference:  For more information on evidentiary concepts of admissibility, credibility, and probative value of evidence, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 1.A.2."

Derwinski, 1 Vet.App. 49 (1990), CAVC noted that an equipoise decision is\nnecessarily more qualitative than quantitative; it is one not capable of mathematical precision and certitude.  Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of material contained in the record; every item of evidence does not have the same probative value.\nCAVC further likened the reasonable doubt rule as akin to the principle in baseball that the “tie goes to the runner.”\nReference:  For more information on the reasonable doubt rule, see\n38 CFR 3.102, and\n38 CFR 4.3."

Shinseki, 731 F.3d 1303 (Fed.Cir.2013), that the absence of a service record documenting an unreported sexual assault or a Veteran’s failure to have reported an alleged assault in service may not be treated as pertinent evidence that the assault did not occur.\nThe Federal Circuit held in Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2000), that when rebutting the presumption of aggravation for a condition incurred during combat, 38 U.S.C. 1154(b) permits consideration of the entire medical history, including a lengthy period of absence of complaint following service about the claimed condition.\nThe Federal Circuit held in Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006), that the Board of Veterans’ Appeals (BVA) erred in determining that lay evidence lacked credibility merely because it was unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence.  Lay evidence may be rejected, when appropriate, due to such findings as possible bias or conflicting statements, and BVA may also consider and weigh the absence of contemporary medical records against the lay evidence of record.  However, this case found that the lack of contemporaneous medical records, in and of itself, does not render lay evidence incredible.\nReference:  For more information on the application of the concept of negative evidence to claims based on sexual assault, see M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 1.E.1.c."

              "content": "Evidence of a current disability is required as one of the components of establishing SC.  Generally, this criterion is satisfied when a current examination or other evidence demonstrates the presence of a chronic disability.  However, the evidence must be reviewed to determine whether a disability was present at the time the claim was filed or during the pendency of the claim but has since resolved.\nThe requirement for a current disability is met if a disability exists when a Veteran files a claim or while the claim is pending, even though the disability resolves before the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) decides the claim.\nA diagnosis that is near-contemporaneous with the filing of a claim must be considered when determining whether a disability existed when the claim was received and/or during its pendency.\nA near-contemporaneous diagnosis is a diagnosis that is dated approximately within one year prior to the date of the claim being submitted.\nA diagnosis that predates, but is near-contemporaneous with, a claim is capable of establishing a current disability under the law.\nA determination of SC will be made on a case-by-case basis with evaluation of all pertinent evidence.  Consider the history of the diagnosis and give appropriate weight to any diagnosis present near-contemporaneously with or during the pendency of a claim.  The weighing of evidence will generally result in one of the following three possible conclusions:\nThe contemporaneous or near-contemporaneous evidence at or near the time of the claim shows a clear diagnosis.  The current medical evidence (often the compensation examination) shows the disability has resolved and no current diagnosis is warranted.  A grant of benefits is in order, generally with a staged disability evaluation.\nThe contemporaneous or near-contemporaneous evidence at or near the time of the claim suggests or reflects a treating or unconfirmed diagnosis but does not clearly establish whether a confirmed diagnosis was present.  The current medical evidence (often the compensation examination) indicates no diagnosis is currently warranted.  The evidence presently of record does not clearly establish whether the prior diagnosis was or was not warranted.  A medical opinion is necessary to reconcile the status of the prior diagnosis.\nThe contemporaneous or near-contemporaneous evidence at or near the time of the claim shows a diagnosis.  The current medical evidence (often the compensation examination) shows a clear finding that the prior diagnosis was in error and includes adequate rationale.  A denial of SC is warranted, assuming that other medical evidence does not refute the current medical opinion.\nExample 1:  A Veteran is diagnosed with eczema regularly throughout service and was treated with topical medications by dermatologists on multiple occasions.  Symptoms waxed and waned, as is typical with eczema, based on seasonal changes.  Service treatment records (STRs) from June 2012 show eczema.  A Benefits Delivery at Discharge claim is submitted, and a VA pre-discharge examination from August 2012 determines that no pathology exists to render a diagnosis of a skin disorder.  The in-service records clearly show a long-standing diagnosis of eczema which was present near-contemporaneously with the claim.  SC should be granted.\nExample 2:  A Veteran claimed SC for sinusitis in March 2008, prior to military discharge in July 2008.  During service, the Veteran was treated variably for upper respiratory infections, ear infections, deviated septum due to an in-service injury, chronic nasal congestion, and sinus problems.  On examination, the Veteran reported pain and headache in the sinus area and non-incapacitating flare-ups two to three times a year.  The examiner provided no diagnosis and indicated that no sinusitis was shown on exam.  The examiner indicated that there was no visible postnasal drainage or significant hypertrophy or posterior oropharyngeal lymphoid tissue.  The examiner explained that the layman concept of sinusitis or sinus problems is understandable, but in the truest sense, from a specialist’s point of view, there is no underlying chronic sinusitis in this case, especially based on the computed tomography (CT) scans.  The examiner indicated that the in-service symptoms were consistent with acute episodes of upper respiratory infection and/or symptoms of deviated nasal septum.  The evidence of record is sufficient to establish SC for traumatic deviated nasal septum.  There is no medical evidence to refute the examiner’s finding that sinusitis is not shown by the medical evidence of record.  SC for sinusitis should be denied.\nReferences:  For more information on\ncurrent disability, see\nMcClain v.

              "content": "An issue within scope is one that is not explicitly identified by the claimant on a one of the forms listed in M21-1, Part II, Subpart iii, 1.A.1.a, but is identified upon review of the claims folder during the decision-making process for an expressly claimed issue.  An issue within scope arises based on a sympathetic reading of the claimant’s statements and/or evidence of record.  It encompasses such things as entitlement to\nany ancillary benefits that arise as a result of the adjudication decision\nadditional benefits for complications/residuals of an expressly claimed condition, and\nunclaimed primary or causal disabilities, when service connection (SC) is warranted for the expressly claimed secondary disability and the unclaimed causal disability.\nNotes:\nVA does not expect, nor does the law require, claimants to articulate with medical precision the disabilities for which compensation is sought.  Veterans regularly claim disability compensation for a specific clinical entity and ultimately establish SC for a similar, but clinically distinct, condition.\nWhen an individual expressly claims a specific disability and is later diagnosed with a different but potentially-related condition, if a sympathetic reading of the claim shows that the diagnosed condition is encompassed by the claim, VA must address the claim as including the diagnosed condition, as discussed in Grimes v. McDonough, 34 Vet.App. 84 (2021).\nExample 1:  VA may, in developing a Veteran’s claim for SC for sinusitis, provide the Veteran with an examination that renders a diagnosis of a similar condition, such as allergic rhinitis, rather than sinusitis.\nResult:  In the event that the examination is otherwise sufficient for rating purposes and the condition is associated with service, the decision maker awards SC for allergic rhinitis as within the scope of the claim for sinusitis.\nExample 2:  The Veteran’s VA examination shows that there is sufficient evidence to justify an increased evaluation of 70 percent for SC posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  In addition, the Veteran reported being fired from several jobs due to an inability to deal with stress, and the VA examiner identified the Veteran’s stress management problem as a symptom of PTSD.\nResult:  The decision maker addresses the issue of individual unemployability (IU) in the rating decision as described in M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 3.C.3.\nExample 3:  The Veteran submits a claim for SC for right knee strain.  The evidence of record, including the resulting examination, shows that SC for the knee strain is warranted.  The examination also reveals a knee scar that resulted from a post-service arthroscopy procedure.  The examination indicates the arthroscopy was associated with the SC right knee strain.  The examination also shows that the scar is not painful or unstable and is less than 6 square inches.\nResult:  In the event that the examination is otherwise sufficient for rating purposes, the decision maker awards SC for the knee condition and separate SC for the noncompensable knee scar as within the scope of the claim for SC for right knee strain.\nExample 4:  The Veteran submits a claim for SC for hearing loss, earaches, and sinusitis.  Later, the Veteran submits a lay statement reporting that everyday sounds cause discomfort.  Private medical records show a diagnosis of hyperacusis.  Hyperacusis was also diagnosed during the VA audiology examination.\nResult:  In view of the evidence, the expressly claimed issue of SC for hearing loss and earaches must be sympathetically read as encompassing the diagnosed disability hyperacusis.  Decreased sound tolerance (hyperacusis) reasonably falls within the claim for an audiological condition manifested by hearing deficits and ear pain.  If the examination is otherwise sufficient for rating purposes, make a decision on SC for hyperacusis.  Otherwise defer for a new and/or adequate examination or other required development.\nReferences:  For more information on\nsympathetic reading of a claim, see\nRobinson v.

Wilkie, 33 Vet.App. 188 (2021) the court held that although residuals of prostate cancer under 38 CFR 4.115b, DC 7528 are rated as voiding dysfunction or renal dysfunction, whichever is predominant, other residual disability caused or aggravated by cancer, or its treatment, may be within scope if reasonably raised by the evidence.  38 CFR 3.155(d)(2) and 38 CFR 3.160 require VA to develop and adjudicate related claims for secondary SC when the claim for the disabilities is reasonably raised during the adjudication of a formally initiated claim for re-evaluation of the primary SC disability.\nEntitlement to SC for the complication/residual, unless explicitly claimed, should only be placed at issue when entitlement is established.  When entitlement is not established, but relevant evidence is present, discussing the relevant evidence is appropriate for inclusion in the Reasons for Decision of the expressly claimed issue.\nWhen evidence shows the presence of a potential complication/residual, decision makers must ensure there is adequate medical evidence, including an examination, if needed, in order to determine entitlement.\nReferences:  For more information on\ncomplications of diabetes, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 11.2\nwhen to consider scars as part of a claim, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 10\nneurological complications of the spine, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 1.B.3.d, and\nrating\nALS and MS, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 12.C\nRA, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 1.C, and\nankylosing spondylitis, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 1.B.3."

BVA remanded this issue on November 1, 2015, and directed that the case be referred for consideration of entitlement to an increased evaluation on an extra-schedular basis from January 6, 2008, to present.\nVA examinations dated June 7, 2008, July 10, 2010, and September 12, 2015, document that the Veteran’s hearing loss has been appropriately evaluated at zero percent disabling for the time period of this review.  Speech recognition scores were 96% for the right ear and 94% for the left ear.\nOn June 20, 2016, another examination was performed.  Testing revealed a slight deterioration in the bilateral hearing loss; however this change is not sufficient to warrant an increased evaluation on a schedular basis.  Speech recognition scores remained at previous levels.  The examiner stated that the Veteran’s hearing loss would not preclude employment.  The examiner further stated that the Veteran would have some difficulty working in situations with a lot of background noise.\nEvidence shows that the Veteran attended college for two years and worked as an engineer following separation from service.  He retired from this position in January of 2012, after 23 years.  Evidence does not show that the bilateral hearing loss interfered with employment.\nExtra-schedular evaluations are assigned in cases where an exceptional or unusual disability picture is presented with such related factors as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization that renders application of regular rating schedular standards impractical. No unusual or exceptional disability pattern has been demonstrated that would render application of the regular rating criteria as impractical.  The evidentiary record does not demonstrate that the symptomatology consistently associated with the service-connected bilateral hearing loss supports an increased evaluation on a schedular or extra-schedular basis for any time period.\nRECOMMENDATION:  [Provide a recommendation, to include an effective date, if applicable.]\nExample:  Deny an increased evaluation on an extra-schedular basis for bilateral hearing loss.\nSIGNATURES:  [Document signatures on VA Form 21-0961 by following procedures in M21-1, Part X, Subpart v, 1.C.3.e.]"

None of the available evidence supports the Veteran’s contention that any of his service-connected disabilities or a combination of the effects of the disabilities prevents all types of gainful activity.\nRECOMMENDATION:  [Provide a recommendation, to include an effective date, if applicable.]\nExample:  Grant entitlement to TDIU on an extra-schedular basis effective June 20, 2017.\nSIGNATURES:  [Document signatures on VA Form 21-0961 by following procedures in M21-1, Part X, Subpart v, 1.C.3.e.]\n4.  P&T Evaluations\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information on the rating determination for DEA under 38 U.S.C.

(The receipt of VA Form 21-526EZ on January 1, 2016, prevents VA from considering the Veteran’s communication of an ITF when choosing an effective date for SC for the back disorder.)\nA Veteran is honorably discharged from active duty on September 1, 2015.\nOn December 1, 2015, VA receives the Veteran’s communication of an ITF.\nOn November 1, 2016, VA receives VA Form 21-526EZ from the Veteran with a claim for SC for a knee disorder.\nThe potential effective date of entitlement to SC for the knee disorder is September 2, 2015, the day following the date of discharge.\nRationale:\nVA received the communication of an ITF within one year of the date of discharge.\nVA received the VA Form 21-526EZ within one year of the date VA received the communication of an ITF.\nOn October 8, 2015, VA receives an ITF for compensation.\nThe in-country Vietnam Veteran subsequently mails VA an original FDC for SC for type 2 diabetes mellitus associated with exposure to Agent Orange.  Evidence shows a diagnosis of diabetes in 1999.\nVA receives the Veteran’s claim on April 11, 2016.\nThe potential effective date of entitlement to SC for diabetes is October 8, 2014, because\nVA received communication of an ITF on October 8, 2015, and\n38 CFR 3.114 applies to the effective date determination.\nOn December 18, 2021, the Veteran files an initial claim for SC of right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy.\nOn March 2, 2022, the Veteran was notified that the claim was denied.  Evidence available at the time of the claim’s adjudication failed to confirm the existence of a clinical diagnosis.\nOn September 13, 2022, VA receives an ITF for compensation from the Veteran.\nOn February 27, 2023, VA receives a supplemental claim for SC for peripheral neuropathy of the right lower extremity from the Veteran.\nThe supplemental claim is accompanied by private medical evidence documenting a clinical diagnosis as early as December 15, 2021.\nThe potential effective date of entitlement to SC for peripheral neuropathy of the right lower extremity is December 18, 2021, the date of the initial claim.\nRationale:\nThe ITF received on September 13, 2022, establishes continuous pursuit of the December 2021 claim as the Veteran filed a(n)\nITF within one year of the March 2022 decision, and\ncomplete supplemental claim within one year of the ITF.\nThe supplemental claim was not finally adjudicated prior to July 30, 2021.  On this date, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, No. 19-1600 (Fed. Cir. 2021), invalidated the portion of 38 CFR 3.155 which precluded the application of ITFs to supplemental claims.\nThe appropriate effective date rule is 38 CFR 3.2500(h)(1), which directs that the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.\nReference:  For more information on ITFs and supplemental claims, see\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 2.A.2.b, and\nPolicy Letter 23-01.\nA new claim for lumbar arthritis is received on June 21, 2022, on VA Form 21-526EZ.\nRating decision dated August 10, 2022, denies entitlement to SC for lumbar arthritis due to no diagnosis.  The Veteran is notified the same day.\nOn December 22, 2022, an ITF for compensation on VA Form 21-0966 is received.\nOn July 21, 2023, a new claim for eczema is received on VA Form 21-526EZ, which changes the ITF status to Claim Received.\nOn August 30, 2023, VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, for lumbar arthritis is received with new and relevant evidence.\nThe potential effective date of entitlement to SC for lumbar arthritis is August 30, 2023, the date the supplemental claim was received.\nRationale:\nThe VA Form 21-526EZsubmitted on July 21, 2023, is the next received compensation claim; therefore, the December 22, 2022, ITF applies to the claim for eczema, not the subsequently filed supplemental claim for lumbar arthritis.\nThe ITF in this scenario does notrepresent continuous pursuit, because the ITF was not in Activestatus when the Veteran filed the supplemental claim.\nThe Veteran filed the supplemental claim more than one year after the notice of decision.\nThe appropriate effective date rule is 38 CFR 3.2500(h)(2), which directs that the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose, but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim.\n3.  Effective Dates for Direct and Secondary SC\nIntroduction\nThis topic includes information clarifying the principles for assigning effective dates for claims for direct and secondary SC under 38 CFR 3.400(b)(2), including\nprocedures for handling claims for direct SC\nexample 1 of the effective date for direct SC\nexample 2 of the effective date for direct SC\nclaims for compensation received within one year of dishonorable service\neffective date for a claim received during a period of hospitalization\neffective dates for secondary SC, and\ncorrelation between effective date for primary and secondary SC.\nChange Date\nJune 24, 2025"

              "content": "In Norris v. West, 12 Vet.App. 413, 420 (1999), the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) held that evidence of a Veteran’s unemployability arising from an already SC disability is evidence of an increase in the severity of that disability.\nWhen considering a claim for individual unemployability (IU) based on an already SC disability(ies), review the evidence to determine whether it is factually ascertainable that the criteria for entitlement to IU were first met during the one-year period prior to the date of receipt of the claim.\nTo determine whether an earlier effective date for IU under 38 CFR 3.400(o)(2)may be assigned, one of the two criteria for entitlement for IU under 38 CFR 4.16(a) must be demonstrated during the one year prior to date of receipt of the IU claim.\nWhen the evidence shows that one or both criteria below are satisfied in the one-year period prior to the date of receipt of the IU claim, an earlier effective date for IU under 38 CFR 3.400(o)(2) is warranted based on the date one or both criteria are satisfied.  Those criteria are\nthe evaluation of the SC disabilities is increased such as to satisfy the criteria for IU, including\na single SC disability rated at 60 percent or more, or\nmultiple SC disabilities yielding a combine rating of 70 percent or more with at least one of those disabilities rated 40 percent or more, and/or\nan inability to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation.\nImportant:\nEntitlement to IU requires that all criteria as described under 38 CFR 4.16(a) or (b) be met.  When one of the criteria has been met for an extended period of time (potentially years before the claim) and the remaining criteria arises during the one-year period prior to the date of receipt of the IU claim, consideration of an earlier effective date for IU is warranted.  Both criteria need not initially arise during the one year prior to receipt of the IU claim so long as both are met sometime prior to the effective date of the grant of entitlement to IU.\nEntitlement to IU is a potential consideration any time an SC disability is evaluated.\nConsequently, 38 CFR 3.400(o)(2) may be applied to the IU effective date\nanytime an SC disability is evaluated and the outcome of the claim either grants or confirms and continues an evaluation causing the Veteran’s SC disabilities to satisfy the schedular criteria described in 38 CFR 4.16(a) for potential IU entitlement, and\nthe claim for IU is received within one year of the decision evaluating the SC disabilities such as to meet the schedular criteria.\nThis is true whether the prior evaluation decision resulted in the schedular criteria having been met\nfor the first time\nbased on a confirmed and continued evaluation, or\nbased on an increased evaluation, even when the criteria were previously first met at the time of a prior determination.\nReferences:  For more information on\nthe effective date of a grant of increased compensation based on unemployability, see Dalton v.

              "content": "The following court holdings and General Counsel opinion clarify the applicability of 38 CFR 3.157(b)(1).\nIn MacPhee v. Nicholson, 439 F.3d 1323 (2006), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that although the language of 38 CFR 3.157(b)(1) refers to claims to reopen, in this case the claim to reopen is limited in scope for compensation purposes to those disabilities for which SC has already been established.  Medical reports concerning a disability for which SC has not been granted cannot be used to trigger application of 38 CFR 3.157(b)(1).\nIn Massie v. Shinseski, 724 F.3d 1325 (2013), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit made the following findings:\nA physician’s letter does not qualify as a report of examination under 38 CFR 3.157(b)(1) because it was not generated in connection with any particular VA medical examination.  The medical record in question must describe the results of a specific, identifiable VA or uniform service facility outpatient or hospital examination.\nFor 38 CFR 3.157(b)(1) to be considered an informal claim, the report of examination or hospitalization must demonstrate that the Veteran’s SC disability worsened since the time it was last evaluated for rating purposes.\nIn Munro v. Shinseki, 616 F.3d 1293 (2010), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that 38 CFR 3.157(b) establishes that evidence such as VA medical reports be accepted as informal claims for increased compensation, not that informal claims require separate consideration from formal claims.  Furthermore, it is not necessary for VA to address every one of these informal claims separately.  The implicit denial rule may be applied to terminate the pending status of both formal and informal claims.\nIn Pacheco v. Gibson, 27 Vet.App. 21 (2014), the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held that a previous allowance of non-service-connected (NSC) pension cannot result in an earlier effective date under 38 CFR 3.157(b)(1) for a claim to reopen a previously denied claim for SC.  Rather, a previous allowance of NSC pension can result in an earlier effective date for an increased pension claim or a claim to reopen a pension claim previously denied because the disability was not permanently and totally disabling.\nIn VAOPGCPREC 5-2003, General Counsel found that the provision of 38 CFR 3.157(b)(1) stating that the date of admission to a uniform services hospital will be accepted as the date of receipt of a claim for increased benefits is applicable to Veterans hospitalized in private facilities at Department of Defense expense under the TRICARE program.\n2.  Effective Dates Based on Historical 38 CFR 3.155\nIntroduction\nThis topic includes information clarifying the principles for determining effective dates under historical 38 CFR 3.155, including the applicability of\ninformal claims, and\n38 CFR 3.114 to informal claims.\nChange Date\nSeptember 22, 2017"

The minimum compensable evaluation may be assigned under 38 CFR 4.59 based on subjective painful motion, and does not require objective evidence of painful motion.\nMultiple precedential court decisions have impacted the application of 38 CFR 4.59, as discussed at M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 1.A.1.b-k.  These holdings must be applied in determining whether the minimum compensable evaluation for a disability based on painful motion is warranted under 38 CFR 4.59.\nReference:  For more information on considering painful motion when assigning multiple LOM evaluations for a joint, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 1.A.3.e."

McDonald, 27 Vet.App. 472 (2016).\n38 CFR 4.59 does not include a specific provision limiting application to major joints or provisions for how to consider groups of minor joints.  Thus, major joint involvement or multiple minor joint involvement is not a factor in determining whether a minimum compensable evaluation may be assigned under 38 CFR 4.59.\nThe following principles apply when evaluating painful motion of the minor joints of the hands and feet:\n38 CFR 4.71a, DC 5228 and 5229 allow for compensable evaluations for LOM of the thumb, index finger, and long finger.  Consequently, compensable evaluations are warranted for painful motion of each of these fingers.  Separate evaluations must be assigned for each SC digit evaluated under these DCs affected by painful motion.\nPainful motion of multiple toes of one foot due to injuries is most appropriately evaluated under 38 CFR 4.71a, DC 5284 since there is no specific code for evaluation of injuries of single toes.  A single evaluation is warranted for a single foot, whether it is affected by one or more painful toes or other painful joints of the foot.  The minimum compensable evaluation for this DC is 10 percent.  Therefore, a single 10-percent evaluation is warranted for painful motion of one of more toes or other joints in a foot due to injury.\nDo not routinely utilize 38 CFR 4.71a, DC 5280 to evaluate painful motion of the first toe.\nAssignment of a 10-percent evaluation for painful motion of the first toe under 38 CFR 4.71a, DC 5280 is appropriate only when the disability being evaluated is hallux valgus or another disability that is most appropriately analogously evaluated as hallux valgus (as required in the Sowers holding).\nAssignment of the minimum compensable evaluation for painful motion due to hammertoes evaluated under 38 CFR 4.71a, DC 5282 requires involvement of all five toes unless the hammertoes are due to injury, in which case the painful motion of less than five toes could be alternatively evaluated under 38 CFR 4.71a, DC 5284.\nNote:  The definition of joint that is reliant on the distinction of major and minor joints at 38 CFR 4.45(f) is applicable for the purpose of rating arthritis but is notapplicable to 38 CFR 4.59.\nReferences:  For more information on\nthe application of 38 CFR 4.45(f) for major and minor joints, see Spicer v.

STRs show one instance of tinnitus.  The Veteran did not submit a lay statement of continuity.  There is no post service medical evidence of continuity concerning tinnitus or tinnitus symptoms.\nAn examination and medical opinion are needed.\nThough tinnitus is a condition listed under 38 CFR 3.309(a), it is sometimes acute and transitory.  In most cases, the cause of tinnitus is unknown.  Tinnitus can be associated with hearing loss, exposure to loud noise, ear disease, head injury (traumatic brain injury), cerebrovascular disease, tumors, certain medications, and many other medical conditions.\nIn accordance with 38 CFR 3.303(b), continuity of symptomatology is required when the condition noted during service is not, in fact, shown to be chronic or where chronicity may be legitimately questioned.  When the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported, then a showing of continuity after discharge is required to support the claim.  Because the chronicity in this example is not adequately supported, granting this claim without an examination would be premature.\nAdversely, because the threshold for ordering an audiological examination is very low, denying this claim without an examination would be inappropriate.  For this example, an examination and medical opinion must be ordered.\nReferences:  For more information on\nrequesting examinations in audiological claims, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 2.B.1.a-d, and\nassessing lay evidence to establish the occurrence of an in-service event or injury, see\nM21-1, Part IV, Subpart i, 1.B\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 1.B\n38 CFR 3.304(d), and\nJandreau v.

Section  Next Section -->\nOverview\nIn This Chapter\nThis chapter contains the following topics:\nTopic\nTopic Name\n1\nGeneral Rating Principles for Infectious Diseases, Immune Disorders, and Nutritional Deficiencies\n2\nTropical Diseases\n3\nRheumatic Fever\n4\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-Related Illness\n5\nChronic Fatigue Syndrome\n6\nNovel Coronavirus Infection (COVID-19)\n1.  General Rating Principles for Infectious Diseases, Immune Disorders, and Nutritional Deficiencies\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information about the general rating principles for infectious diseases, immune disorders, and nutritional deficiencies, including\ndefinition of\ninfectious diseases\nimmune disorders, and\nnutritional deficiencies\nrevisions of the infectious diseases, immune disorders, and nutritional deficiencies rating schedule\nevaluations under the infectious diseases general rating formula, and\nevaluating long-term health effects of 38 CFR 3.317 infectious diseases.\nChange Date\nAugust 12, 2019\nV.iii.3.1.a.  Definition:  Infectious Diseases\nInfectious diseases are disorders caused by organisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites.\nExample:  Malaria.\nNote:  Consider presumptive service connection (SC) for infectious diseases listed in\n38 CFR 3.309(b) based on tropical service\n38 CFR 3.309(c) based on confirmed former prisoner of war (FPOW) status, and\n38 CFR 3.317(c) based on service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Gulf War or on or after September 19, 2001, in Afghanistan.\nReferences:  For more information on presumptive SC for\ntropical diseases, see M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iii, 1\nFPOW disabilities, see M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 2.D, and\ninfectious diseases under 38 CFR 3.317, see M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart ii, 1.D.\nV.iii.3.1.b.  Definition:  Immune Disorders\nImmune disorders cause abnormally low activity or overactivity of the immune system.  In cases of immune system overactivity, the body attacks and damages its own tissues (autoimmune diseases).  Immune deficiency diseases decrease the body's ability to fight invaders, causing vulnerability to infections.  Immune disorders can be caused by organisms, use of medications, or other chronic conditions.\nExample:  Systemic lupus erythematosus.\nNote:  Consider presumptive SC for immune disorders listed in 38 CFR 3.309(a).\nV.iii.3.1.c.  Definition:  Nutritional Deficiencies\nNutritional deficiencies occur when the body is unable to obtain the necessary amount of a nutrient that is required for proper health.  These deficiencies can be caused by diet, surgical residuals, genetics, environment, or other diseases.\nExample:  Beriberi.\nNote:  Consider presumptive SC for disabilities listed in SC 38 CFR 3.309(c) based on based on confirmed FPOW status.\nReference:  For more information on presumptive SC for FPOW disabilities, see M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 2.D.3.\nV.iii.3.1.d.  Revisions of the Infectious Diseases, Immune Disorders, and Nutritional Deficiencies Rating Schedule\nThe criteria for rating disabilities based on infectious diseases, immune disorders, and nutritional deficiencies in 38 CFR 4.88b were most recently updated effective\nAugust 11, 2019, and\nAugust 30, 1996.\nThe purpose of these updates was to\nincorporate medical advances\nupdate medical terminology\nadd disabilities not previously included, and\nrefine rating criteria.\nNote:  These updates were not liberalizing changes in the rating criteria.\nReferences:  For more information on\nthese and other historical changes to 38 CFR 4.88b, see\n38 CFR 4, Appendix A, and\n38 CFR 4.88b (Historical), and\neffect of rating schedule readjustment, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.D.2.i.\nV.iii.3.1.e.  Evaluations Under the Infectious Diseases General Rating Formula\nPrior to the August 11, 2019, rating schedule revision, each infectious disease listed under 38 CFR 4.88b had its own prescribed rating criteria.\nEffective August 11, 2019, 38 CFR 4.88b contains a general rating formula applicable to multiple infectious diseases, regardless of etiology.\nFor each diagnostic code (DC) that refers to this general rating formula, decision makers must\nassign the prescribed evaluation during the active disease phase, and thereafter,\nassign\na 0-percent evaluation for the infectious disease under the relevant 38 CFR 4.88b DC, and\nevaluations for any residual disability of the infection within the appropriate body system as indicated by the notes in the evaluation criteria.\nNotes:\nRegardless of whether resolution occurs spontaneously or because of treatment, long-term disability in such situations results from residual functional impairment of the body systems affected by the infectious disease, rather than the infection itself.\nInfectious diseases for both the initial diagnosis and any relapse of active infection must be confirmed by diagnostic testing specific to the disease.\nV.iii.3.1.f.  Evaluating Long-Term Health Effects of 38 CFR 3.317 Infectious Diseases\nAs applicable, consider the long-term health effects potentially associated with infectious diseases as listed in 38 CFR 3.317(d), specifically for brucellosis, Campylobacter jejuni, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), malaria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, nontyphoid Salmonella, Shigella, visceral leishmaniasis, and West Nile virus.\nReference:  For more information on presumptive SC for infectious diseases under 38 CFR 3.317, see M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart ii, 1.D.\n2.  Tropical Diseases\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information about tropical diseases, including\nspecific tropical diseases\nobtaining information about tropical diseases\nincubation periods of tropical diseases, and\nconsidering SC for tropical diseases not of record.\nChange Date\nDecember 13, 2005\nV.iii.3.2.a.Specific Tropical Diseases\nThe following tropical diseases, among others, may require attention in view of their incidence in areas of foreign service:\nbacterial infections, including\nbacillary dysentery\ncholera\nHansen’s disease (leprosy)\nOroya fever\npinta\nplague\nrelapsing fever, and\nyaws\nviral infections, including yellow fever\nroundworm parasitic infections, including\ndracontiasis\nfilariasis (Bancroft’s type)\nhookworm infection\nloiasis, and\nonchocerciasis\nother parasitic infections, including\namebiasis\nblackwater fever\nleishmaniasis\nmalaria,

(Old World cutaneous and American (New World) mucocutaneous leishmaniasis) under diseases of the skin.\nReference:  For more information on tropical diseases, see\n38 CFR 3.307(a)(4)\n38 CFR 3.309(b), and\nM21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iii, 1.\nV.iii.3.2.b.Obtaining Information About Tropical Diseases\nAn understanding of the locality, incubation period, and residuals of tropical diseases may be obtained from standard treatises.\nReference: For more information on tropical diseases, see The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy.\nV.iii.3.2.c.Incubation Periods of Tropical Diseases\nThe table below contains the incubation periods of some tropical diseases.\nTropical Disease\nIncubation Period\ndracontiasis (Guinea worm disease)\n14 months\nfilariasis, Bancroft’s type\nup to 8 to 12 months\nkala-azar (visceral leishmaniasis)\nup to one year\nHansen’s disease (leprosy)\nfive years or more\nloiasis, calabar swelling\nthree years\noriental sore, Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis\nup to 18 months\nV.iii.3.2.d.Considering SC for Tropical Diseases Not of Record\nWhen considering SC for tropical diseases not of record during service, always\nconsider tropical residence other than that during military service, and\nconsult standard texts for disease factors, such as\nlocality of confinement\nearly symptoms\ncourse of the disease, and\nperiods of incubation.\nReference:  For more information on developing claims for SC for tropical diseases, see M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iii, 1.\n3.  Rheumatic Fever\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information about rheumatic fever, including\ndefinition of rheumatic fever\ncomplications of rheumatic fever\nthe prognosis of rheumatic fever, and\nconsidering the effects of rheumatic heart disease.\nChange Date\nDecember 13, 2005\nV.iii.3.3.a.Definition: Rheumatic Fever\nRheumatic fever is an acute, subacute, or chronic systemic disease that, for unknown reasons, is self-limiting or may lead to slowly progressive valve deformity of the heart.\nReference:  For more information on evaluating rheumatic fever, see 38 CFR 4.88b, DC 6309.\nV.iii.3.3.b.Complications of Rheumatic Fever\nComplications of rheumatic fever include\ncardiac arrhythmias\npericarditis\nrheumatic pneumonitis\npulmonary embolism\npulmonary infarction\nvalve deformity, and\nin extreme cases, congestive heart failure.\nV.iii.3.3.c.Prognosis of Rheumatic Fever\nThe prognosis is good in cases of rheumatic fever.\nIf the age of onset is postadolescence, residual heart damage\noccurs in less than 20 percent of the cases, and\nis generally less severe than if the onset is during childhood.\nNote:  Mitral valve insufficiency is the most common residual.\nV.iii.3.3.d.Considering the Effects of Rheumatic Heart Disease\nFor more information on the effects of rheumatic heart disease, see\n38 CFR 4.104, DC 7000, and\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 5.1.g.\n4.  HIV-Related Illness\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information about HIV-related illness, including\ndefinition of\nHIV, and\nacquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)\nhow HIV infection is diagnosed\ndefinition of CD4 T cells\nHIV transmission\ndefinition of approved medication(s)\nrating considerations for HIV-related illness, and\nrating AIDS.\nChange Date\nAugust 12, 2019\nV.iii.3.4.a.Definition:HIV\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is spread through body fluids that affect specific cells of the immune system, called CD4 cells, or T cells.  Over time, HIV can destroy so many of these cells that the body cannot fight off infections and disease.\nReference:  For more information on rating HIV, see\n38 CFR 4.88b, and\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 3.4.g.\nV.iii.3.4.b.  Definition:  AIDS\nAcquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a secondary infection and results from HIV infection.  It is not a single distinct disease, but rather a disorder characterized by a severe suppression of the immune system, rendering the body susceptible to and unable to fight off a variety of normally manageable infections, cancers, and other diseases.\nPatients with AIDS suffer infections called “opportunistic” because they take the opportunity to attack when the immune system is weak.  This may involve the intestinal tract, lungs, brain, eyes, and other organs, as well as debilitating weight loss, diarrhea, and neurologic conditions.\nImportant:  If a Veteran has HIV and one or more of the following opportunistic infections, regardless of the CD4 (T4) count, the Veteran is considered to have a diagnosis of AIDS:\ncandidiasis of the bronchi, trachea, esophagus, or lungs\ninvasive cervical cancer\ncoccidioidomycosis\ncryptococcosis\ncryptosporidiosis\ncytomegalovirus (particularly CMV retinitis)\nHIV-related encephalopathy\nherpes simplex-chronic ulcers for greater than one month, or bronchitis, pneumonia, or esophagitis\nhistoplasmosis\nisosporiasis (chronic intestinal)\nKaposi’s sarcoma\nlymphoma\nmycobacterium avium complex\ntuberculosis\npneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) pneumonia\npneumonia, recurrent\nprogressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy\nsalmonella septicemia, recurrent\ntoxoplasmosis of the brain, and\nwasting syndrome due to HIV.\nReference:  For more information on rating AIDs, see\n38 CFR 4.88b, and\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 3.4.h.\nV.iii.3.4.c.  How HIV Is Diagnosed\nHIV is primarily detected by testing a person’s blood for the presence of antibodies (disease-fighting proteins) to HIV.  Two antibody tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot assay (a confirmatory test), are used.  An alternative test, indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), may also be used.\nThe ELISA and Western blot may be negative for as long as three to six months after exposure to HIV.\nIf a person is highly likely to be infected with HIV, but both tests are negative, a test for the presence of HIV itself in the blood may be done.\nV.iii.3.4.d.  Definition: CD4 T Cells\nA CD4 T cell is a type of lymphocyte, the white blood cell that bears the major responsibility for the activities of the immune system.  The other major type is the B cell.  Together, they fight off invading viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi.  The \"T4,\" \"helper-T,\" or \"CD4\" cell helps regulate and direct immune activity.\nNotes:\nA healthy, uninfected person has 800 to 1200 (or 500 to 1500 by some references) CD4 T cells per cubic millimeter of blood.\nDuring HIV, the number of these cells in the blood progressively declines.\nWhen the count falls below 200, the person is vulnerable to the opportunistic infections and cancers that typify AIDS.\nV.iii.3.4.e.  HIV Transmission\nMajor means of HIV transmission are\nsexual contact\ninfected blood, and\nneedle stick accidents.\nNotes:\nNo evidence exists that HIV is transmitted through\nsaliva, sweat, tears, urine, or feces\ncasual contact such as the sharing of food utensils, towels and bedding, swimming pools, telephones, or toilet seats, or\nbiting insects such as mosquitoes, flies, ticks, fleas, bees, wasps, or bedbugs.\nIf there is evidence indicating that the HIV-related illness was the result of intravenous drug abuse, ensure that the authorization activity has conducted a willful misconduct/line-of-duty (LOD) administrative decision prior to rating.\nThere is no presumptive SC provision for HIV.  Veterans must establish SC under other provisions, such as direct SC under 38 CFR 3.303 by establishing an in-service event, injury, or disease as the cause of HIV.\nReferences:  For more information on\nwillful misconduct and LOD determinations, see M21-1, Part X, Subpart iv, 1.C, and\nestablishing direct SC, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 2.A.\nV.iii.3.4.f.  Definition: Approved Medication(s)\nWhen rating an HIV case, the term approved medication(s) includes treatment regimens and medications prescribed as part of a research protocol at an accredited medical institution.\nV.iii.3.4.g.  Rating Considerations for HIV-Related Illness\nWhen evaluating HIV-related illness, consider\nseverity and frequency of constitutional symptoms\nuse of approved medication(s)\nT4 cell count, and\nthe development of AIDS-related opportunistic infection or neoplasm.\nNotes:\nOnly patients with HIV who are asymptomatic should be rated at 0 percent.\nAn evaluation of 30 percent should be the minimum if there are recurrent constitutional symptoms, even if they have responded to appropriate treatment.\nIn rating HIV, consider the following:\nrating may be based on 38 CFR 4.88b, DC 6351 criteria, or\nseparate evaluations may be warranted under the appropriate diagnostic codes (DCs) if other defined conditions due to HIV infection or its treatment develop.  This could include psychiatric illness, central nervous system manifestations, opportunistic infections, and neoplasms.\nExamples:\nEnlarged lymph nodes and fatigue (HIV-related constitutional symptoms) warrant a 10-percent evaluation; however, if pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or other symptoms develop, the appropriate evaluation could be 30 percent if the symptoms go into remission and then reoccur (recurrent symptoms) or 60 percent if they do not respond to treatment (refractory symptoms).\nIf there is a CD4 count of 400, the Veteran is on HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy), and there are symptoms of depression but no other significant signs or symptoms of the infection or its treatment, it would be appropriate to assign 10 percent.  However, if the depression rises to the level of a diagnosed major depression or dysthymic disorder, consider evaluating it separately as a secondary condition, with the potential of a higher rating.  The HIV infection would still warrant a 10-percent evaluation under 38 CFR 4.88b, DC 6351, based on findings not related to symptoms of depression—low CD4 count and treatment.\nReference:  For more information on avoidance of pyramiding, see\n38 CFR 4.14\nEsteban v. Brown, 6 Vet.App. 259 (1994), and\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.D.2.b.\nV.iii.3.4.h.  Rating AIDS\nOnce a Veteran develops AIDS, evaluate the specific findings based on the table below.\nIn instances of ...\nNote that ...\nopportunistic infections\nonce an AIDS-related opportunistic infection or neoplasm appears, the rating will be 60 percent or above\nmany of the opportunistic infections will warrant a 100- percent evaluation, at least for a time (tuberculosis, lymphoma, etc.), and\nspecial monthly compensation will be a frequent consideration.\ncancer\nit should be rated separately, if advantageous to the Veteran, as long as its symptomatologies are not also used to support a 60- or 100-percent evaluation under 38 CFR 4.88b, DC 6351.\nepisodic problems\nthe possibility exists that a particular examination may have been done at a time between episodes of opportunistic infections when findings are relatively few, and\nthe overall history for the past year or so should be considered when rating since some AIDS complications can be episodic.\nReference:  For more information on rating evaluations for AIDS, see 38 CFR 4.88b.\n5.  Chronic Fatigue Syndrome\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information about chronic fatigue syndrome, including\ndefinition of chronic fatigue syndrome, and\nrating considerations for chronic fatigue syndrome.\nChange Date\nAugust 12, 2019\nV.iii.3.5.a.Definition:Chronic Fatigue Syndrome\nChronic fatigue syndrome is a complex, multisymptom, debilitating illness characterized by physical and mental manifestations.\nV.iii.3.5.b.  Rating Considerations for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome\nWhen rating chronic fatigue syndrome, keep in mind that a diagnosis requires the following:\nnew onset of debilitating fatigue severe enough to reduce daily activity to less than 50 percent of the usual level for at least six months, and\nthe exclusion, by way of a thorough evaluation, of all other clinical conditions that may produce similar symptoms based on history, physical examination, and laboratory tests.\nIn addition, six or more of the following criteria must be met:\nacute onset of the condition\nlow grade fever\nsore throat with no secretions (nonexudative pharyngitis)\npalpable or tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes\ngeneralized muscle aches or weakness\nfatigue lasting 24 hours or longer after exercise\nheadaches (of a type, severity, or pattern that is different from headaches in the pre-morbid state)\nmigratory joint pains\nneuropsychological symptoms, and\nsleep disturbance.\nNote:  Consider presumptive SC for chronic fatigue syndrome as a medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness under 38 CFR 3.317(a).\nReference:  For more information on chronic fatigue syndrome, see\n38 CFR 4.88a\n38 CFR 4.88b, and\nM21-1, Part VIII, Subpart ii, 1.A.1.g.\n6.  COVID-19\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information about rating decisions for COVID-19, including\ndefinition of COVID-19\nuse of the COVID-19 special issue indicator\nactive vs. acute COVID-19\nresiduals of COVID-19\ndelayed onset of COVID-19 residuals\ndisabilities resulting from COVID-19 vaccination\nhospitalization and convalescent ratings for COVID-19 residuals, and\napplicable theories of SC for COVID-19 residuals.\nChange Date\nAugust 2, 2022\nV.iii.3.6.a.  Definition:  COVID-19\nNovel Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a disease caused by a virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).  COVID-19 may also be referred to as any of the following:\ncoronavirus, or\ncoronavirus disease.\nNote:  Consider claims for SC for COVID-19 under both a presumptive and direct basis.\nReferences:  For more information on\npresumptive SC for COVID-19, see\n38 U.S.C. 1164, and\nM21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iii, 10, and\nconsidering unclaimed theories of SC, see M21-1, Part II, Subpart iii, 1.A.2.f.\nV.iii.3.6.b.  Use of the COVID-19 Special Issue Indicator\nThe COVID-19 special issue indicator referenced in M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iii, 10.3.a should be used for all COVID-19 claims regardless of the theory of SC being utilized in the claim.\nReference:  For more information on the use of special issue indicators, see M21-4, Appendix E, 2.\nV.iii.3.6.c.  Active vs. Acute COVID-19\nCOVID-19 is an acute infectious disease.  As an acute infectious disease, COVID-19 should only be rated based on chronic residual condition(s).  If a Veteran previously had COVID-19 and is currently asymptomatic, deny the claim based on no evidence of a current, chronic disability.\nImportant:  Do not arbitrarily determine that a chronic disability is not demonstrated without relying on competent medical evidence.\nReferences:  For more information on\nconsidering acute and transitory conditions, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 2.A.1.h, and\nhandling allegations of exposure to COVID-19, see\nM21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iii, 10.3.b, and\nM21-1, Part II, Subpart iii, 1.C.2.b and c.\nV.iii.3.6.d.  Residuals of COVID-19\n38 CFR 4.88b advises to rate any residual disability of infection within the appropriate body system.  As applicable, consider the long-term health effects potentially associated with the infectious disease.  If COVID-19 was diagnosed and resolved during a period of qualifying service or any applicable presumptive period, any chronic residuals attributable to the disease may be SC.\nAssign the most appropriate DC for residuals based on general rating principles.\nSerious long-term complications may include, but are not limited to, the following types of issues:\nrespiratory\ngenitourinary (residuals of acute kidney injury)\ncardiovascular (inflammation of the heart muscle, heart attack, stroke, blood clots)\nskin (rash, hair loss)\naudiological (hearing problems)\nloss of sense of smell and/or taste\nneurological, and\npsychiatric (depression, anxiety, changes in mood).\nImportant:\nSince the long-term effects of this disease are still being studied, decision makers must rely on the expertise of medical professionals to determine whether the chronic residual is due to COVID-19.  A medical nexus opinion will generally be required to determine whether a disability is a chronic residual of COVID-19.\nEvaluations for pension purposes must be based on permanent residuals of COVID-19.\nReference:  For more information on requesting examinations in claims for SC for residuals of COVID-19, see M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iii, 10.5.\nV.iii.3.6.e.  Delayed Onset of COVID-19 Residuals\nPost-COVID-19 conditions are a wide range of new, returning, or ongoing health problems people can experience four weeks or more after first being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.  If a Veteran is denied SC for COVID-19 due to a lack of a chronic residual disability, a condition may manifest later.\nWhen a new or supplemental claim is submitted for a post-COVID chronic residual that manifested at a later date, consider SC for the claimed issue.  The claim(s) for the post-COVID-19 residual is sufficient new and relevant evidence in a supplemental claim scenario.  Request an examination and/or medical opinion, when otherwise warranted, to link the condition to the prior COVID-19 infection.\nExample 1:  A Veteran with an in-service diagnosis of COVID-19 is denied entitlement to compensation because there is no evidence of a chronic residual.  Two months later, a new claim for headaches due to COVID-19 is received.  This is an initial claim for a new issue that may be associated with an in-service event.  Service treatment records are negative for headache complaints.  An exam and medical opinion may be needed to determine whether the claimed headaches are a chronic, post-COVID-19 residual disability.\nExample 2:  A Veteran with an in-service diagnosis of COVID-19 is denied entitlement to compensation because there is no evidence of a chronic residual.  Two months later, a supplemental claim for COVID-19 is received with evidence of a new positive COVID-19 test.  There is no allegation or indication of a chronic condition.  The evidence is new and relevant, but continued denial is warranted because there is no evidence of a chronic residual disability.\nReferences:  For more information on\nthe definitions of\ninitial claim, see M21-1, Part I, Subpart i, 1.A.4.i, and\nsupplemental claim, see M21-1, Part I, Subpart i, 1.A.4.j, and\nnew and relevant evidence, see M21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 2.A.2.d.\nV.iii.3.6.f.  Disabilities Resulting From COVID-19 Vaccination\nIf evidence establishes that an individual suffers from a disabling condition as a result of receiving a COVID-19 vaccination, the disability is subject to SC under the general principles for direct SC.\nNote:  If the vaccination-related residual is the result of vaccination received during a period of inactive duty training (IADT), the individual may be considered disabled by an “injury” incurred during such training.  Consequently, such an individual may be found to have incurred disability, on a direct basis, allowing recognition of the IADT period as a period of active service under 38 CFR 3.6.\nReference:  For more information on the requirements for IADT to be considered active service, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 2.A.2.f.\nV.iii.3.6.g.  Hospitalization and Convalescent Ratings for COVID-19 Residuals\nIf a Veteran is hospitalized due to a complication of COVID-19 for over 21 days, apply the provisions of 38 CFR 4.29 to assign a hospital rating.\nAssign the hospital rating for the primary condition that warranted hospitalization.\nIf the primary cause of the hospitalization is unknown, consider reported symptoms and other evidence of record to determine the most appropriate disability for which to assign the hospitalization rating.\nIf the Veteran remains hospitalized at the time the claim is considered, assign an open-ended hospital evaluation as warranted.\nFollowing the hospitalization, assign an appropriate schedular evaluation for any chronic residual, applying 38 CFR 4.31 when appropriate.\nNote:  Application of 38 CFR 4.30 requires surgical treatment, which may occur for treatment of certain COVID-19 residuals.  However, do not apply the provisions of 38 CFR 4.30(a)(2) concerning the necessity of house confinement to a period of self-quarantine due to COVID-19 since self-quarantine would be unrelated to the surgical treatment.\nReferences:  For more information on\nhospitalization ratings, see M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 8.B, and\nconvalescent

System Conditions\nArticle ID: 554400000014520\nUpdated May 28, 2025\n﻿﻿<-- Previous Section  Next Section -->\nOverview\nIn This Chapter\nThis chapter contains the following topics:\nTopic\nTopic Name\n1\nRating Principles for Heart Conditions\n2\nEvaluating Diseases of the Heart\n3\nRating Principles for Hypertension\n4\nResiduals of Cold Injuries\n5\nOther Cardiovascular Disabilities\n1.  Rating Principles for Heart Conditions\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains miscellaneous cardiovascular concepts and principles, including\ndefinition of arteriosclerotic heart disease\ndocumentation required to support a diagnosis of arteriosclerotic heart disease\nmanifestations of advanced arteriosclerotic disease in service\ndocumentation of myocardial infarction (MI)\neffective dates and liberalizing changes affecting service connection (SC) for ischemic heart disease (IHD)\nconsidering cardiovascular conditions subsequent to amputation\neffects of rheumatic heart disease, and\ndefinition of congenital heart defects.\nChange Date\nFebruary 5, 2024\nV.iii.5.1.a.  Definition:  Arteriosclerotic Heart Disease\nArteriosclerotic heart disease, also diagnosed as ischemic heart disease (IHD) and coronary artery disease (CAD), is a disease of the heart caused by the diminution of blood supply to the heart muscle due to narrowing of the cavity of one or both coronary arteries due to the accumulation of fatty material on the inner lining of the arterial wall.\nNote:  IHD refers only to heart disease, and therefore, does not include hypertension or peripheral manifestations of arteriosclerosis such as peripheral vascular disease or stroke.  Consider presumptive service connection (SC) for IHD under 38 CFR 3.309(e).\nReference:  For more information on the definition of IHD, see\n38 CFR 3.309(e), and\nM21-1, Part VIII, Subpart i, 2.B.1.c.\nV.iii.5.1.b.  Documentation Required to Support a Diagnosis of Arteriosclerotic Heart Disease\nFor rating purposes, a diagnosis of arteriosclerotic heart disease must be documented by objective testing.  Objective tests include, but are not limited to\nelectrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) findings\ntreadmill exercise testing (with or without a thallium scan),or\ncardiac catheterization and angiography.\nNote:  The actual test results do not need to be of record if the evidence indicates that the diagnosis was rendered by a competent medical professional and based on the results of an objective test.\nImportant:  Symptoms of chest pain alone are not sufficient to support a clinical diagnosis of arteriosclerotic heart disease for rating purposes.  As chest pain is a symptom of multiple disabilities, the diagnosis of arteriosclerotic heart disease mustbe supported with objective documentation.\nV.iii.5.1.c.  Manifestations of Advanced Arteriosclerotic Disease in Service\nWhen SC for a cardiovascular condition is claimed, the mere identification of arteriosclerotic disease upon routine examination early in service is not a basis for SC.\nManifestation of lesions or symptoms of chronic disease will establish pre-service existence under 38 CFR 3.303(c) if objective evidence shows manifestation\nfrom date of enlistment, or\nso close to enlistment that chronic disease could not have originated during service.\nImportant:\nAn analysis of the presumption of soundness under 38 CFR 3.304 and the provisions on aggravation under 38 CFR 3.306 may be required.\nGrant SC for any sudden development during service of coronary occlusion or thrombosis whether or not these are manifestations of advanced long-standing arteriosclerotic disease.\nNote:  Under 38 CFR 3.6(a), inactive duty for training qualifies as active service if an individual becomes disabled or dies from an acute myocardial infarction (MI), a cardiac arrest, or a cerebrovascular accident occurring during such training.\nV.iii.5.1.d.  Documentation of MI\n38 CFR 4.104, diagnostic code (DC) 7006 requires documentation of an MI by laboratory tests.  Health providers may rely on a variety of diagnostic tests to document MI.\nTesting may include, but is not limited to,\nEKG\ncardiac enzymes (Troponin, CKMB), and\nradionuclide imaging.\nThe Heart Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) elicits information about testing conducted in support of cardiac workup.\nIf an assessment of an MI appears to have been made without diagnostic testing or if there is a question about whether the assessment was supported by appropriate testing, obtain clarification from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) examiner or other provider.\nReference:  For more information on evaluating medical evidence, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 1.A.3.\nV.iii.5.1.e.  Effective Dates and Liberalizing Changes Affecting SC for IHD\nIHD became a condition presumptively associated with herbicide exposure effective August 31, 2010.  This was a liberalizing change of law.\nTherefore, unless an earlier effective date is available under the provisions of 38 CFR 3.816, consider the application of 38 CFR 3.114(a) when granting presumptive SC for IHD related to herbicide exposure under the provisions of 38 CFR 3.307(a)(6) and 38 CFR 3.309(e).\nReferences:  For more information on\nthe addition of presumptive conditions under the provisions of 38 CFR 3.309(e), see M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart i, 1.B.1.i\nthe definition of IHD, see\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 5.1.a, and\nM21-1, Part VIII, Subpart i, 2.B.1.c, and\neffective dates associated with liberalizing changes of law, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 4.A.6.\nV.iii.5.1.f.  Considering Cardiovascular Conditions Subsequent to Amputation\nGrant SC on a secondary basis for the following conditions that develop subsequent to the service-connected (SC) amputation of one lower extremity at or above the knee, or SC amputations of both lower extremities at or above the ankles:\nIHD, or\nother cardiovascular disease, including hypertension.\nReferences:  For more information on\nproximate results or secondary conditions, see 38 CFR 3.310(b)\nsecondary SC, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 2.D, and\nassignment of effective dates for secondary SC, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 4.A.3.f.\nV.iii.5.1.g.  Effects of Rheumatic Heart Disease\nChronic rheumatic heart disease results from single or repeated attacks of rheumatic fever that produce valvular disease, manifested by\nrigidity and deformity of the cusps\nfusion of the commissures, or\nshortening and fusion of the chordae tendineae.\nThe earliest evidence of organic valvular disease is\na significant murmur, and\nhemodynamically significant valvular lesions found on x-ray, fluoroscopy, and ECG study, since these reveal the earliest stages of specific chamber enlargement.\nNote:  Grant SC for an aortic valve insufficiency that manifests without other cause after an in-service case of rheumatic fever.\nV.iii.5.1.h.  Definition:  Congenital Heart Defects\nCongenital heart defects include common heart conditions due to prenatal influences, such as\npatent foramen ovale\npatent ductus arteriosus\ncoarctation of the aorta, and\nintraventricular septal defect.\n2.  Evaluating Diseases of the Heart\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information about applying the evaluation criteria for diseases of the heart, including\nevaluating heart disease using metabolic equivalents (METs)\nimpact of non-service-connected (NSC) conditions on the evaluation of METs\naspirin as continuous medication\nevaluation of nephritis and cardiovascular disabilities\nevaluating arrhythmias, and\nconsidering co-existing heart conditions and arrhythmia.\nChange Date\nNovember 15, 2021\nV.iii.5.2.a.  Evaluating Heart Disease Using METs\nThe General Rating Formula (GRF) for Diseases of the Heart relies on the measured or estimated workload capacity of the heart using metabolic equivalents (METs) at which symptoms of heart failure occur for the assignment of disability evaluations.\nWhen METs cannot be obtained through exercise testing for medical reasons, the examiner may provide an estimation of the METs.\nImportant:  The examiner must state that the estimated METs are due solely to an SC cardiovascular disability.\nReferences:  For more information on\nthe definition of MET, see Note 2 of the GRF for Diseases of the Heart at 38 CFR 4.104\nsymptoms of heart failure, see Note 3 of the GRF for Diseases of the Heart at 38 CFR 4.104\nprovisions for the application of the general rating formula for diseases of the heart, see 38 CFR 4.100, and\nthe historical use of congestive heart failure and ejection fraction when evaluating diseases of the heart, see\nhistorical 38 CFR 4.104 in effect prior to November 14, 2021, and\nthe attachment Historical_M21-1V_iii_5_9-15-21.\nV.iii.5.2.b.  Impact of NSC Conditions on the Evaluation of METs\nNon-service-connected (NSC) disabilities, such as a chronic respiratory condition or morbid obesity, may have an impact on METs results.\nWhen an examiner cannot determine METs attributable to an SC cardiovascular disability due to the effects of NSC conditions and provides a sufficient rationale detailing why the determination cannot be provided, follow the guidance in M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.D.2.c.\nV.iii.5.2.c.  Aspirin as Continuous Medication\nAspirin is a medication that may be medically recommended for control of a cardiovascular disability such as an ischemic stroke, angina, or coronary artery bypass graft.\nWhen considering a compensable evaluation based on need for continuous medication as provided in 38 CFR 4.100(a) and the GRF for evaluating diseases of the heart as provided in 38 CFR 4.104 for the 10-percent evaluation, aspirin treatment must be medically required for care of the SC cardiovascular disorder.\nA medical professional must have advised the claimant to use aspirin to reduce disability from the SC cardiovascular disorder or to prevent additional disability from that disorder.\nA formal prescription to obtain the medication from a pharmacy is not required given that aspirin is an over-the-counter medication.\nSelf-directed or voluntary use of aspirin by a claimant who is a layperson will not be accepted as competently proving that aspirin treatment is medically necessary for treatment of the SC cardiovascular disorder.\nTo satisfy the requirement of “continuous” medication the evidence must show an ongoing regimen – not periodic, irregular use.\nTake care not to incorrectly conclude that an aspirin treatment regimen is necessary simply because aspirin appears on a current medication list.  A medication list may not contain enough information to conclude:\nwhether aspirin was medically recommended or self-prescribed\nwhether aspirin is being used for the SC cardiovascular condition or another disability, and/or\nhow frequently aspirin is being taken.\nV.iii.5.2.d.  Evaluation of Nephritis and Cardiovascular Disabilities\n38 CFR 4.115 states that separate ratings cannot be assigned for disability from disease of the heart and any form of nephritis.\nReference:  For more information on the limits on separate evaluation of nephritis and cardiovascular conditions, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 7.2.g.\nV.iii.5.2.e.  Evaluating Arrhythmias\nThe impairment and disability resulting from one or more types of arrhythmia, evaluated under 38 CFR 4.104, DCs 7009-7011 and 7015, are essentially indistinguishable.  Consequently, assignment of multiple evaluations under any of these DCs would be in violation of 38 CFR 4.14.\nAssign a single evaluation under the DC which reflects the predominant disability picture for the arrhythmia(s) in question.\nV.iii.5.2.f.  Considering Co-Existing Heart Conditions andArrhythmia\nWhen questions arise as to whether a single or separate evaluations may be assigned for co-existing cardiovascular disabilities, such as arrhythmias and other cardiovascular diseases, consider whether the criteria for evaluating the disability and/or the symptoms of the disability are separate and distinct and apply 38 CFR 4.14 and any other condition-specific guidance.\nWhen the evaluation criteria are separate and distinct, the symptoms do not overlap, and no specific prohibition applies, separate evaluations are warranted.\n3.  Rating

coexisting with hypertensive or arteriosclerotic heart disease.\nChange Date\nFebruary 5, 2024\nV.iii.5.3.a.  Definitions: Hypertension and Isolated Systolic Hypertension\nTwo types of hypertensive vascular disease are defined in 38 CFR 4.104, DC 7101, Note 1.\nHypertension means elevated diastolic blood pressure is predominantly 90mm or greater.\nIsolated systolic hypertension means that systolic blood pressure is predominantly 160mm or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90mm.\nNote:  Use of the term “hypertension” in reports or in VA guidance will most often be used as a synonym for any type of hypertensive vascular disease.\nV.iii.5.3.b.  Blood Pressure Readings Required for SC of Hypertension\nSubject to the exception below, SC for hypertensive vascular disease requires current blood pressure readings (obtained during the claim period) which meet the regulatory definition of either\nhypertension, or\nisolated systolic hypertension.\nException:  Current readings meeting the regulatory standards for the definitions above are not required if\nthe competent evidence shows a diagnosis of hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension, currently controlled by (or asymptomatic with) medication, and\na past competent diagnosis was made\nin service\nbased on manifestation of blood pressure readings to a compensable degree within the presumptive period as provided in 38 CFR 3.307 and 38 CFR 3.309(a), or\nsecondary to an SC disability.\nNotes:\nWhen SC is established based on the exception above (where current readings do not meet the regulatory definitions), the disability percentage will be either 0 percent or 10 percent, depending on whether or not the predominant diastolic pressure was 100 or more before symptoms were controlled with medication as provided in 38 CFR 4.104, DC 7101.\nA disability first clearly diagnosed after service can be SC under 38 CFR 3.303(d) when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service\nReference:  For more information on\nthe concept of competent evidence and policies on evaluating the competency of evidence, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 1.A.\nV.iii.5.3.c.  Confirmation With Multiple Blood Pressure Readings\nIn addition to the definitional requirements for a diagnosis of hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension 38 CFR 4.104, DC 7101  provides a second criterion that must be met for a diagnosis to be acceptable.\nSubject to the exceptions below, a diagnosis of hypertension (or isolated systolic hypertension) must be confirmed by blood pressure readings taken two or more times on at least three different days.\nThe rulemaking for the regulation stated that the purpose of this requirement, was to “assure that the existence of hypertension is not conceded based solely on readings taken on a single, perhaps unrepresentative, day.”\nExceptions:\nIn a claim for reevaluation of SC hypertension, readings on multiple days are not required.  The policy, reflected in the Hypertension Disability Benefits Questionnaire, is that where hypertension has been previously diagnosed, the examiner is only required to take three blood pressure readings on the day of examination.\nSimilarly, multiple confirmatory readings are not required when there is a past diagnosis with hypertensive vascular disease currently controlled on medication as provided in M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 5.3.b.\nNote 1 in 38 CFR 4.104, DC 7101 does not require that a diagnosis of either type of hypertensive vascular disease in service treatment records (STRs) has been confirmed by readings taken two or more times on each of three different days for the purposes of in-service incurrence.\nImportant:  The decision maker must critically evaluate the evidence to ensure the in-service diagnosis was based on blood pressure readings in accordance with 38 CFR 4.104, DC 7101 and M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 5.3.b in claims for SC for hypertension where\nhypertension is currently diagnosed, and\ncontrolled with medication.\nIf the evidence is unclear, medical clarification and/or a medical opinion may be warranted.\nReferences:  For more information on\nevaluating evidence and making a decision, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 1.A, and\nrequesting medical examinations and medical opinions, see\nM21-1, Part IV, Subpart i, 1.A, and\nM21-1, Part IV, Subpart i, 2.A.\nV.iii.5.3.d.  Pre-Hypertension\nPre-hypertension is generally defined as systolic pressure between 120mm and 139mm and diastolic pressure from 80mm to 89mm.\nPre-hypertension is not a disability for VA purposes.\nIf the VA examination (or evidence used in lieu of a VA examination) contains only a diagnosis of pre-hypertension based on readings that do not meet the definition of hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension, do not\nseek clarification, or\ngrant SC for hypertension based on the diagnosis.\nException:  Clarification may be required if a current diagnosis of “pre-hypertension” is made where readings exist in the record that meet the regulatory definition of hypertension.  This may indicate\nconflicting evidence, and/or\nequivocation by the medical professional on diagnosis or chronicity (particularly if, for example, the facts show a predominance of readings not meeting the regulatory definition of hypertension).\nReferences:  For more information on\nevaluating medical evidence, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 1.A.3\ndeveloping for additional evidence when needed, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.B.1.a, and\nhandling examination reports insufficient for rating purposes, see M21-1, Part IV, Subpart i, 3.C.\nV.iii.5.3.e.  Predominant Blood Pressure in Evaluations of Hypertension\nEvery level of evaluation specified under 38 CFR 4.104, DC 7101 requires consideration of the predominant (most common or prevailing) blood pressure. Blood pressure may fluctuate depending on a number of variables and disability evaluations must be based on valid evidence demonstrating representative disability.\nGenerally the regulation requires analysis of predominant current readings— readings from the period during which an effective date can be assigned.\nWhen current predominant blood pressure readings are non-compensable, a 10-percent evaluation may be assigned if\ncontinuous medication is required for blood pressure control, and\npast diastolic pressure (before medication was prescribed) was predominantly 100 or greater.\nImportant:  Do not assign a 10-percent evaluation based upon a showing of one of the two conjunctive criteria above by invoking the benefit of the doubt rule (38 CFR 3.102 and 38 CFR 4.3 or 38 CFR 4.7).  When either criterion is simply not shown (for example, the claimant is using prescribed anti-hypertensive medication but diastolic pressure has never been predominantly 100 or greater) the evidence is not in relative equipoise on whether a 10-percent evaluation is appropriate and the disability picture does not more nearly approximate the 10-percent criteria.\nHowever, 38 CFR 3.102, 38 CFR 4.3, and 38 CFR 4.7 may be applicable to whether the evidence supports each criterion, namely\nwhether diastolic readings before were predominantly 100 or higher or\nwhether continuous medication is required for control of blood pressure.\nUse the table below to assist in analyzing predominant blood pressure.\nWhen ...\nThen ...\ndetermining which diastolic or systolic pressure range is predominant\nmake note of the competent and credible evidence of diastolic and systolic readings (see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 1.A)\ndetermine which readings correspond with the various levels of evaluation specified in the diagnostic criteria (for example diastolic readings “100 or more” or “110 or more”), and\nsubject to the notes below, conclude that the range with the most qualifying readings is the predominant blood pressure.\nNotes:\nIf there is a relative balance of readings supporting two levels of evaluation for the same time frame, apply 38 CFR 3.102, 38 CFR 4.3 and 38 CFR 4.7.\nExample:  If there are six diastolic measurements from one doctor in the 100 to 109 range (108, 106, 108, 104, 106, 100) in June, and six diastolic readings from another doctor in the 110 to 119 range (110, 110, 114, 110, 112, 110) the same month, give the benefit of the doubt and assign the higher 20-percent evaluation.\nIf during the evaluation period more than one blood pressure range is supported for at least a month stage the evaluation in accordance with the facts.\nExample:  Use the readings above but assume second doctor’s readings were taken in November. Assign a 10-percent evaluation based on the June results from the date of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is the later; stage to 20 percent as of the date of the first readings from November.\nconsidering predominant blood pressure before control with medication\nstart with the more current of\nthe readings taken as part of the diagnostic workup period leading to the diagnosis of hypertension if medication was prescribed at that time, or\nthe readings taken as part of a subsequent diagnostic workup period leading to the prescription of medication.\nExplanation:  These are the readings pertinent to whether hypertensive readings were predominantly in the compensable range before hypertension was brought under control with medication.\nDo not consider\nnormal blood pressure readings taken long before the diagnosis of hypertensive vascular disease was made, or\nminimally hypertensive readings prior to active medical surveillance or observation leading to the prescription of medication.\nExplanation:  These are not pertinent and will impermissibly skew the analysis of the predominant blood pressure.\nconsidering a history of predominant blood pressure for the purposes of a 10 percent evaluation under 38 CFR 4.104, DC 7101\nonly consider blood pressure readings obtained when the Veteran was undergoing a diagnostic evaluation for hypertension, and\ndo not consider other clinical records documenting treatment prior to the diagnostic evaluation for hypertension.\nV.iii.5.3.f.  Long Term Effects of Hypertension\nHypertension may\nexist for years without causing symptoms\nso increase the cardiac load as to result in hypertrophy of the cardiac muscle or cardiac dilation and decompensation, if sufficiently severe, and\ncause arteriosclerosis of uneven distribution that often involves the vessels of one organ to a greater degree than those of the rest of the body, in cases where hypertension is long-standing.\nIf the hypertension is of sufficient degree to cause significant impairment of circulation to the organ, symptoms will manifest in accordance with the\norgan involved, and\ndegree of impairment.\nV.iii.5.3.g.  Granting SC for Arteriosclerotic Manifestations Due to Hypertension\nIf additional arteriosclerotic manifestations are subsequently diagnosed in a Veteran with SC hypertension, grant SC on a secondary basis through the relationship to hypertension for any of the following:\ncerebral arteriosclerosis or thrombosis with hemiplegia\nnephrosclerosis of the kidneys with impairment of renal function, or\nmyocardial damage or coronary occlusion of the heart.\nImportant:  A claim for benefits is required to adjudicate a secondary SC claim for any of the arteriosclerotic manifestations.\nNotes:\nAddress SC for the above-listed cardiovascular conditions through the relationship to the hypertension when a sympathetic reading of the Veteran’s claim reasonably implies a claim for SC for those conditions.\nArteriosclerosis occurs with advancing age without preexisting hypertension, and may occur in some younger individuals who are predisposed to arterial changes.\nThe existence of arteriosclerosis does not imply/indicate prior hypertension.\nReferences:  For more information on\nsecondary SC, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 2.D, and\nsympathetic reading and scope of claim, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.A.\nV.iii.5.3.h.  Effective Dates of Arteriosclerotic Manifestations Granted Secondary to Hypertension\nThe effective date of any grant of SC for arteriosclerotic manifestations secondary to hypertension is the date of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.\nImportant:\nArteriosclerotic manifestations are not considered a worsening of hypertensive vascular disease (hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension) rated under 38 CFR 4.104, DC 7101.  They are separate conditions which may be secondary to hypertensive vascular disease, but which nonetheless must be evaluated under rating criteria specific to their symptomology and the functions and anatomical localities they affect.  Therefore, do not apply 38 CFR 3.400(o)(2) to allow an effective date prior to the date of claim, as this only applies to increases.\nIf awarding SC for a disability as within scope of the hypertension claim, apply an effective date based on the date of claim for hypertension.\nReferences:  For more information on\nscope of claim, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.A\nsecondary SC, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 2.D, and\neffective dates, see\n38 CFR 3.400, and\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 4.A.\nV.iii.5.3.i.  SeparatelyEvaluating Hypertension and Heart Disease\nEvaluate hypertension separately from hypertensive heart disease and other types of heart disease.\nEvaluate hypertension due to aortic insufficiency, which is usually the isolated systolic type, as part of the condition causing it rather than by a separate evaluation.\nNotes:\nThe cause of hypertension is unknown in the vast majority of cases.\nDo not establish SC for hypertension if the evidence does not contain blood pressure readings as specified in 38 CFR 4.104, DC 7101, Note 1.\nV.iii.5.3.j.  Prohibition on Separate Evaluation of Hypertension  and Renal Dysfunction from Nephritis\n38 CFR 4.115 prohibits assignment of separate evaluations for renal dysfunction from nephritis and for hypertension except where\nthe sole renal disability is absence of a kidney (even if that was due to nephritis), or\nnephritis has progressed to the point where regular dialysis is required.\nReferences:  For more information on\npyramiding of evaluations for nephritis and hypertension, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 7.2.c\nassignment of separate evaluations for nephropathy and hypertension, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 7.2.g, and\nseparating findings that constitute a single disability and the 38 CFR 4.14prohibition against pyramiding, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.D.2.b.\nV.iii.5.3.k.  Evaluating Rheumatic Heart Disease Coexisting With Hypertensive or Arteriosclerotic Heart Disease\nAccepted medical principles do not concede an etiological relationship between rheumatic heart disease and either hypertensive or arteriosclerotic heart disease.  Therefore, do not extend secondary SC to systemic manifestations or arteriosclerosis in areas remote from the heart if the Veteran is SC for rheumatic heart disease.\nIf a Veteran who is SC for rheumatic heart disease develops hypertensive or arteriosclerotic heart disease after the applicable presumptive period following military discharge, request a medical opinion to determine which condition is causing the current signs and symptoms.\nNote:  If the examiner is unable to separate the effects of one type of heart disease from another, follow the guidance in M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.D.2.c.\n4.  Residuals of Cold Injuries\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information about residuals of cold injury, including\ngeneral effects of injury due to cold\nlong-term effects of exposure to cold\ngranting SC for residuals of cold injuries\nx-ray findings in cold injury cases\nconsidering\ncircumstances of service in cold injury cases, and\ncold injuries incurred during the Chosin Reservoir Campaign, and\ngranting SC for cold injuries incurred during the Chosin Reservoir Campaign.\nChange Date\nNovember 15, 2021\nV.iii.5.4.a.  General Effects of Injury Due to Cold\nInjury due to exposure to extremely cold temperatures causes structural and functional disturbances of\nsmall blood vessels\ncells\nnerves\nskin, and\nbone.\nThe physical effects of exposure may be acute or chronic, with immediate or latent manifestations.\nExamples:  Exposure to\ndamp cold temperatures (around freezing) cause frostnip and immersion or trench foot.\ndry cold, or temperatures well below freezing, cause frostbite with, in severe cases, loss of body parts, such as fingers, toes, earlobes, or the tip of the nose.\nV.iii.5.4.b.  Long-Term Effects of Exposure to Cold\nThe fact that the immediate effects of cold injury may have been characterized as “acute” or “healed” does not preclude development of disability at the original site of injury many years later.\nThere does not need to be continuity of symptoms following a cold injury.  Typically symptoms may last for days up to a week or two after the cold injury.  Unless there was a loss (such as part of a hand or foot), the initial injury is followed by a long symptom-free period, after which signs and symptoms may reoccur.\nAn SC cold injury is, therefore, evaluated based on those residuals identified in 38 CFR 4.104, DC 7122.\nV.iii.5.4.c.  Granting SC for Residuals of Cold Injuries\nGrant SC for the residuals of cold injury if\nthe cold injury was incurred during military service, and\nan intercurrent NSC cause cannot be determined.\nNotes:\nThe fact that an NSC systemic disease that could produce similar findings is present, or that other areas of the body not affected by cold injury have similar findings, does not necessarily preclude SC for residual conditions in the cold-injured areas.\nWhen considering the possibility of intercurrent cause, always resolve reasonable doubt in the Veteran’s favor.\nReference:  For more information on reasonable doubt, see 38 CFR 3.102.\nV.iii.5.4.d.  X-Ray Findings in Cold Injury Cases\nFor appropriate evaluation of cold injuries under the criteria of 38 CFR 4.104, DC 7122, it is very important that there be medical evidence addressing whether or not x-ray abnormalities (specifically osteoporosis, subarticular punched out lesions, or osteoarthritis) exist.\nThe Cold Injury Residuals Disability Benefits Questionnaire instructs that the x-ray abnormalities (osteoporosis, subarticular punched out lesions, or osteoarthritis) must be confirmed by x-rays.  Once these abnormalities have been documented no further imaging studies are indicated.  This means that x-ray studies do not have to be completed on each and every subsequent examination after the specified abnormalities have been documented.\nThe DBQ asks the examiner whether x-rays have been performed and if so to provide the date of the studies.\nIf an examination is necessary for evaluation purposes, x-ray studies were not performed as part of the examination, and the specified x-ray abnormalities have not been previously documented, return the examination.\nReferences:  For more information on\nexamination report requirements, see M21-1, Part IV, Subpart i, 3.A, and\nhandling examinations insufficient for rating purposes, see M21-1, Part IV, Subpart i, 3.C.\nV.iii.5.4.e.  Considering Circumstances of Service in Cold Injury Cases\nConsider the circumstances of service as provided in 38 U.S.C. 1154(a) and 38 CFR 3.303(a), even if STRs are not positive for a claimed cold injury.\nAlso as provided in 38 U.S.C. 1154(b) and 38 CFR 3.304(d), in cases involving cold injuries related to documented combat service, satisfactory lay evidence of service conditions will be accepted if consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of combat service even if there is no official documentation in service records.\nFor example, the Battle of the Bulge (Ardennes/Rhineland) in the winter of 1944/1945 during World War II was known for its extreme cold.  If participation in the Battle of the Bulge is confirmed by the DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, or personnel records, concede exposure to extreme cold.  If the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the circumstances of service are consistent with claimed service in the Battle of the Bulge, concede exposure to extreme cold.\nAfford an examination if the circumstances are consistent with exposure to extreme cold, proving an event in service, and the criteria for a necessary examination are otherwise met.\nReference:  For more information on determining whether an examination is necessary, see\n38 CFR 3.159(c)(4), and\nM21-1, Part IV, Subpart i, 1.A and B.\nV.iii.5.4.f.  Considering Cold Injuries Incurred During the Chosin Reservoir Campaign\nThe Chosin Reservoir Campaign was conducted during the Korean War, October 1950 through December 1950, in temperatures of –20ºF or lower.  Many participants in this campaign suffered from frostbite for which they received no treatment and, as a result, there may be no STRs to directly support their claims for frostbite.\nIf the Veteran’s participation in the Chosin Reservoir Campaign is confirmed, concede exposure to extreme cold under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 1154(a).\nV.iii.5.4.g.  Granting SC for Cold Injuries Incurred During the Chosin Reservoir Campaign\nGrant SC under the provisions of 38 CFR 3.303(a) and 38 CFR 3.304(d) if\nthe Veteran has a disability which is diagnosed as a residual of cold injury, and\nthere are no other circumstances to which this disability may be attributed.\n5.  Other Cardiovascular Disabilities\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information about other cardiovascular disabilities, including\nevaluating Raynaud’s syndrome and Raynaud’s disease\ntesting requirements for peripheral arterial disease, and\nchanges in the rating schedule for the cardiovascular system.\nChange Date\nFebruary 5, 2024\nV.iii.5.5.a. Evaluating Raynaud’s Syndrome and Raynaud’s Disease\nRaynaud’s syndrome and Raynaud’s disease are unrelated in etiology and severity.  Raynaud’s disease is more common and tends to be less severe than Raynaud’s syndrome.\nRaynaud’s syndrome (also known as secondary Raynaud’s phenomenon) is typically caused by autoimmune diseases such as scleroderma, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, or polycythemia.  This condition is rated under 38 CFR 4.104, DC 7117.\nRaynaud’s disease (also known as primary Raynaud’s phenomenon) is idiopathic (due to an unknown cause).  This condition is rated under 38 CFR 4.104, DC 7124.\nNote:  A Veteran cannot receive simultaneous ratings under both 38 CFR 4.104, DC 7117 and DC 7124 because Raynaud’s disease and Raynaud’s syndrome cannot be comorbid conditions.\nV.iii.5.5.b.  Testing Requirements for Peripheral Arterial Disease\nUnder 38 CFR 4.104, DC 7114, Note 2, peripheral arterial disease may be evaluated utilizing ankle brachial index, ankle pressure, toe pressure, or transcutaneous oxygen tension values.\nThe ankle/brachial index is the most common type of testing for evaluating peripheral arterial disease.  In some situations, ankle/brachial index measurement is not appropriate for a given disability.  In those cases, ankle pressure, toe pressure, or transcutaneous oxygen tension values are more appropriate tests.\nIf the ankle pressure, toe pressure, and/or transcutaneous oxygen tension measurements are not of record, evaluate based on the ankle/brachial index unless the examiner indicates that one of the other tests is necessary.\nIf more than one test result is available, evaluate using the test result that results in the highest evaluation.\nV.iii.5.5.c.  Changes in the Rating Schedule for the Cardiovascular System\nThe rating criteria for cardiovascular conditions have undergone historical changes.  Recent full-scale historical revisions were effective on the following dates:\nNovember 14, 2021, and\nJanuary 12, 1998.\nNotes:\nThese changes in the rating criteria\nare not considered liberalizing, and\nshould not be the basis for a reduction in disability rating unless medical evidence establishes that the disability has actually improved.\nA regulatory change to 38 CFR 4.104, DC 7122 effective August 13, 1998, further revised, but did not substantively change, the evaluation criteria of long-term effects of cold injury residuals.\nReferences:  For more information on\nrevised rating schedule criteria and effective dates, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 4.A.6, and\nevaluating disabilities following rating schedule readjustment, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.D.2.\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, Chapter 6 - Digestive Disabilities\nArticle ID: 554400000014523\nUpdated May 28, 2025\n<-- Previous Section  Next Section -->\nOverview\nIn This Chapter\nThis chapter contains the following topics:\nTopic\nTopic Name\n1\nAssigning Evaluations for Digestive Disabilities\n2\nService Connection (SC) Considerations Involving Digestive Disabilities\n3\nSC and Evaluation Considerations Involving Hepatitis\n1.  Assigning Evaluations for Digestive Disabilities\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information about assigning evaluations for digestive disabilities, including\nregulatory framework for assigning evaluations for digestive disabilities\nprohibition of separate evaluations for certain coexisting digestive disabilities\nevaluating coexisting digestive disabilities that cannot be separately evaluated\nexample of evaluating coexisting digestive disabilities, and\nchanges to the rating schedule for the digestive system.\nChange Date\nMay 20, 2024\nV.iii.6.1.a.  Regulatory Framework for Assigning Evaluations for Digestive Disabilities\nDisabilities of the digestive system are rated using\n38 CFR 4.112 (weight loss and nutrition)\n38 CFR 4.113 (coexisting abdominal conditions), and\n38 CFR 4.114 (the schedule of ratings for the digestive system).\n38 CFR 4.112 defines terms used in diagnostic criteria in 38 CFR 4.114 that involve weight and nutrition.\n38 CFR 4.113 provides a general warning that certain coexisting digestive conditions (those listed in the prefatory instruction in 38 CFR 4.114) cannot be separately evaluated without pyramiding.\n38 CFR 4.114 contains diagnostic codes (DCs) and associated criteria for disabilities of the digestive system.  It also contains a general principle that certain listed DCs cannot be separately evaluated and combined.\nV.iii.6.1.b.  Prohibition of Separate Evaluations for Certain Coexisting Digestive Disabilities\n38 CFR 4.114 prohibits assigning separate evaluations for certain coexisting digestive disabilities.  The purpose of the prohibition, as is further explained in 38 CFR 4.113 and 38 CFR 4.14, is so that digestive disabilities, particularly within the abdomen, with closely related overlapping manifestations will not be combined under 38 CFR 4.25, resulting in extra compensation for the same disability or facet of disability.\nAssignment of separate evaluations for any combination of the following DCs is prohibited:\n7301 through 7329\n7331\n7342\n7345 through 7350\n7352, and\n7355 through 7357.\nExceptions:  Effective May 19, 2024, 38 CFR 4.114 does not categorically prohibit evaluating hiatal hernia separately from another condition in the above list, as long as the specific evaluations do not pyramid under 38 CFR 4.14.  This is because as of that date, hiatal hernia (38 CFR 4.114, DC 7346) is evaluated using the diagnostic criteria for esophageal stricture (38 CFR 4.114, DC 7203), which is not included in the listed DCs.\nAdditionally, some DCs provide instructions to rate residuals not addressed in the diagnostic criteria under another DC.  38 CFR 4.114, DC 7319 (irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)) contains a note that says, “Evaluate other symptoms of a functional digestive disorder, not encompassed by this diagnostic code, under the appropriate diagnostic code, to include gastrointestinal dysmotility syndrome (DC 7356), following the general principles of § 4.14 and this section.”\nWhen the primary DC for the diagnosis, and a DC for rating other residuals not encompassed in the primary DC are both listed in 38 CFR 4.114, the evaluations can be combined on a case-by-case basis as long as the symptoms used to provide each evaluation do not pyramid under 38 CFR 4.14.\nImportant:\nWhere disabilities that fall within the range of DCs above cannot be separately evaluated and included in a combined evaluation, a single evaluation will be assigned as provided in M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 6.1.c.  As explained in that block, elevation of the evaluation may be appropriate.\nWhen separately evaluating and combining DCs is prohibited under 38 CFR 4.114, the Codesheet must still reflect each service-connected (SC) disability.\nNotes:\nSeparately evaluating and combining 7200-series DCs (such as Barrett’s esophagus) with a 7300-series DC (such as IBS or Crohn’s disease) is not categorically prohibited by 38 CFR 4.114.\nSimilarly, separately evaluating and combining multiple 7200-series DCs is not categorically prohibited.\nWhenever considering DCs that are not included in the 38 CFR 4.114 list above, always carefully consider whether specific diagnostic criteria will compensate the same facet of disability and therefore violate 38 CFR 4.14.\nV.iii.6.1.c.  Evaluating Coexisting Digestive Disabilities That Cannot Be Separately Evaluated\nUnder 38 CFR 4.113 and 38 CFR 4.114 when there are coexisting digestive disabilities for which multiple evaluations cannot be assigned\na single rating will be assigned under the DC which reflects the predominant disability, and\nthat evaluation will be elevated to the next higher evaluation when the severity of the overall disability warrants it.\nThe Veterans Benefits Management System – Rating (VBMS-R) Evaluation Builder is programmed to appropriately apply the provisions of 38 CFR 4.114 but it is critical that\nthe user input the symptoms that support the elevation, and\nthe symptoms coincide with the criteria listed in the rating schedule.\nFor instructions on proper application of the 38 CFR 4.114 provision on assigning an evaluation in cases of multiple qualifying coexisting digestive disabilities see the table below.\nStep\nAction\n1\nDetermine which of the coexisting digestive conditions is the predominant disability.\nImportant:\nTo determine the predominant disability, determine the evaluation each condition would support on its own.  The condition that has the highest disability evaluation is the predominant disability.\nIf the same evaluation would be assigned to each, go through the analysis in the steps, alternatively treating each condition as the predominant one to see if one alternative provides a more advantageous outcome to the Veteran.\n2\nDetermine if there are symptoms of the non-predominant disability that do not overlap with those of the predominant disability.\nIf yes, go to Step 3.\nIf no, go to Step 4.\n3\nReevaluate the predominant disability but this time also consider the non-overlapping symptoms of the non-predominant disability.\nImportant:  The non-overlapping symptoms must support a higher evaluation when applied to the DC criteria being utilized for the predominant disability.\nDetermine if the resultant evaluation is higher than the evaluation for the symptoms of the predominant disability alone (as derived in Step 1).\nIf yes, go to Step 5.\nIf no, go to Step 4.\n4\nRate the coexistent disabilities together under the rating criteria for the predominant disability without elevation to the next higher evaluation.\nNo further action necessary.\n5\nRate the coexistent disabilities together under the rating criteria for the predominant disability and elevate to the next higher evaluation.\nNo further action necessary.\nImportant:  The “next higher level of evaluation” is the lowest evaluation specified in the DC for the predominant disability that provides greater compensation than the evaluation derived in Step 1 (the evaluation that would be supported by only the symptoms of the predominant disability without the symptoms of the lesser disability).  Do not simply add 10 percent.\nV.iii.6.1.d.  Example:  Evaluating Coexisting Digestive Disabilities\nSituation:  A Veteran has two coexisting digestive disabilities:\npeptic ulcer disease meeting the criteria for a 20-percent evaluation under 38 CFR 4.114, DC 7304 (two episodes of abdominal pain lasting for three consecutive days in duration in the past 12 months managed by daily prescribed medication), and\nulcerative colitis of the large bowel, meeting the criteria for a 30-percent evaluation under 38 CFR 4.114, DC 7323, which is evaluated using the criteria for Crohn’s disease or undifferentiated inflammatory bowel disease in 38 CFR 3.114, DC 7326 (mild disease managed with oral and topical agents other than immunosuppressants or other biologic agents, and characterized by recurrent abdominal pain with 3 or fewer daily episodes of diarrhea and minimal signs of toxicity including infrequent low grade fever).\nResult:  Separate evaluations for the peptic ulcer disease and ulcerative colitis are not permitted under 38 CFR 4.114.  A single 30-percent evaluation under 38 CFR 4.114, DC 7323 would be assigned.\nExplanation:  Ulcerative colitis represents the predominant disability picture as it supports the higher evaluation on its own.\nThere are no non-overlapping symptoms of peptic ulcer disease to establish any of the criteria supporting the next higher 60-percent evaluation for ulcerative colitis:  moderate inflammatory bowel disease that is managed on an outpatient basis with immunosuppressants or other biologic agents; and is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain, four to five daily episodes of diarrhea; and intermittent signs of toxicity such as fever, tachycardia, or anemia.  Therefore, the coexistent disabilities must be rated together under the rating criteria for the predominant disability without elevation to the next higher 60-percent evaluation.\nSituation:  A Veteran has two coexisting digestive conditions:\nIBS, meeting the criteria for a 10-percent evaluation under 38 CFR 4.114, DC 7319 (abdominal pain related to defecation at least once during the previous three months; and two or more of the following: (1) change in stool frequency, (2) change in stool form, (3) altered stool passage (straining and/or urgency), (4) mucorrhea, (5) abdominal bloating, or (6) subjective distension), and\nhiatal hernia, meeting the criteria for a 10-percent evaluation under 38 CFR 4.114, DC 7346, which is rated as stricture of the esophagus under 38 CFR 4.114, DC 7203 (documented history of esophageal stricture(s) that requires daily medications to control dysphagia otherwise asymptomatic).\nResult:  Effective May 19, 2024, separate evaluations for IBS and hiatal hernia are permitted under 38 CFR 4.114.\nExplanation:  Even though the DCs for hiatal hernia (7346) and IBS (7319) each fall within the range of DCs that the regulation says will not be separately evaluated and combined, they fall within the exception discussed in M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 6.1.b because effective May 19, 2024, 38 CFR 4.114, DC 7346 is evaluated using the criteria in 38 CFR 4.114, DC 7203 (stricture of the esophagus).  The 10-percent criteria for the two DCs do not overlap.  They do not compensate for the same disability or facet of disability, which is prohibited under 38 CFR 4.14.  Note that under historical criteria, these DCs could not be separately evaluated and combined without pyramiding.\nV.iii.6.1.e.  Changes to the Rating Schedule for the Digestive System\nThe schedule of ratings – digestive system, 38 CFR 4.114, was amended effective May 19, 2024.  The final rule added and deleted DCs, and extensively changed diagnostic criteria.  The final rule also deleted regulations with obsolete or redundant guidance on ulcers (38 CFR 4.110) and post-gastrectomy syndrome (38 CFR 4.111).\nThe purpose of the digestive system updates was to ensure that the rating schedule uses current medical terminology and to provide updated more objective evaluation criteria.  The changes were not intended as a liberalization.\nWhen evaluating a claim involving evaluation of a digestive disability that was pending on May 19, 2024, apply the guidance in M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 4.A.6.pon applicability of revised rating schedule criteria.\nImportant:  In some instances, a digestive disorder may have been evaluated under analogous DC – whether using formal conventions for rating by analogy or not.  For example, prior to the current changes, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) did not have its own DC.  The recommended DC for GERD in the past was 7346 (hiatal hernia).  It might appear on the Codesheet as “7399-7346” or just “7346.”  Now the DC is 7206.\nWhere a condition was previously rated by analogy but now has a specific DC, update the DC, but when considering the appropriate current evaluation, apply 38 CFR 3.951(a).  Do not reduce the evaluation solely based on the changed criteria.  The evaluation can only be reduced when medical evidence establishes that the disability has actually improved.  Note that in the case of hiatal hernia and GERD, although the latter condition has its own DC the criteria for evaluating the two conditions is the same.  Hiatal hernia is rated as stricture of the esophagus (38 CFR 4.114, DC 7203), which uses identical criteria to those in 38 CFR 4.114, DC 7206.\nReference:  For more information on protection and rating schedule changes, and reviewing evaluations after a rating schedule change, see M21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 1.B.4.\n2.  SC Considerations Involving Digestive Disabilities\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information about SC considerations involving digestive disabilities, including\nconsidering circumstances of service when determining SC for gastrointestinal disorders\ntesting not required for SC for GERD\nestablishing SC for inguinal hernia\nSC and recurrence of hemorrhoids\nexample of analyzing recurrence of hemorrhoids\nother causes of liver damage, and\nfatty liver.\nChange Date\nOctober 17, 2024\nV.iii.6.2.a.  Considering Circumstances of Service When Determining SC for Gastrointestinal Disorders\nIf the issue is service connection (SC) for dysentery or other gastrointestinal disease, assign great weight to any service under the following conditions since these conditions may have been the etiological or aggravating factor:\ntropical service\nimprisonment or internment under unsanitary conditions, or\nfood deprivation.\nReference:  For more information on establishing presumptive SC for dysentery and other tropical diseases, see 38 CFR 3.309(b).\nV.iii.6.2.b.  Testing Not Required for SC for GERD\nA diagnosis of GERD for SC purposes does not require documentation by medical imaging.\n38 CFR 4.114, DC 7206, Note (1) requires “findings” to be documented by one of three types of imaging:  barium swallow, computed tomography (CT), or esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  This refers to documentation of esophageal stricture for evaluation purposes.  It does not define a sufficient diagnosis of GERD for SC purposes.\nNote:  A 10-percent evaluation for GERD can also be assigned pursuant to 38 CFR 4.7 without imaging to document esophageal stricture when the Veteran requires daily medications.\nV.iii.6.2.c.  Establishing SC for Inguinal Hernia\nDo not assume the preexistence of a hernia.  Determine preexistence on a factual basis.\nThe following conditions are sufficient bases for SC:\nin-service initial manifestation of hernial protrusion, and\nrecurrence during service, by aggravation, of a hernia previously surgically repaired.\nNote:  Operation for repair of a preexisting inguinal hernia is not necessarily evidence of aggravation.\nReference:  For information on the presumption of soundness at entrance into service, see 38 CFR 3.304(b).\nV.iii.6.2.d.  SC and Recurrence of Hemorrhoids\nInitial awards of SC for hemorrhoids are governed by customary rules for SC included in 38 CFR 3.303.\nAfter SC is initially established, unless the award of SC for hemorrhoids was in error, consider recurrences after a period of absence of hemorrhoids post-service to be associated with the SC condition rather than a nonservice-connected superseding condition.\nReference:  For more information on reversing an erroneous decision, see\n38 CFR 3.105(a), and\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 5.A.\nV.iii.6.2.e.  Example: Analyzing Recurrence of Hemorrhoids\nSituation:  SC is established for hemorrhoids first diagnosed during service. A 0-percent evaluation was assigned under 38 CFR 4.114, DC 7336.\nTwo years after SC was granted for hemorrhoids, the Veteran filed a claim for increased evaluation.  Examination showed no hemorrhoids.  The diagnosis was “hemorrhoids, not shown.”  The 0-percent evaluation was continued.\nFive years later the Veteran filed a claim for an increased evaluation for hemorrhoids.  Records showed three instances of doctor visits in the last year for external hemorrhoids with thrombosis.  The Veteran reported a history of “old” problems with hemorrhoids and recent symptoms including bright red blood noted with defecation and discomfort with protracted sitting in his current job.  A Department of Veterans Affairs examination included a similar history and showed external hemorrhoids with thrombosis.  The diagnosis was “external hemorrhoids.”  Examination findings and findings in treatment records demonstrate the criteria for 10-percent evaluation in 38 CFR 4.114, DC 7336.\nResult:  Assign a 10-percent evaluation.  The facts suggest that the SC hemorrhoids were non-disabling, or even absent, for an indeterminate period after SC was granted, and the Veteran’s current history in medical records and at the VA examination could suggest that the current hemorrhoids are due to a superseding post-service cause (protracted sitting at work).  However, the evidence does not prove that current hemorrhoids are due to a superseding cause or that SC was in error.  Pursuant to the principle in M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 6.2.d, after SC is initially established, consider hemorrhoids shown after a period of absence to be associated with the SC condition rather than due to a superseding post service cause unless the award of SC for hemorrhoids was clearly in error.  Do not return the examination for comment on that question.\nV.iii.6.2.f.  Other Causes of Liver Damage\nThe table below describes recognized causes of liver damage and provides examples of each cause.\nCause of Liver Damage\nExample\nInfection\nVirus\nSystemic diseases\nLupus\nDrugs\nIsoniazid\nAcetaminophen\nPhenytoin\nToxic substances\nAlcohol\nV.iii.6.2.g.  Fatty Liver\nFatty liver, also called hepatic steatosis, is not a disability for which SC can be granted.  By itself it is simply considered an abnormal laboratory finding.\nReference:  For more information on abnormal laboratory findings discovered in STRs without a claim, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.C.1.d.\n3.  Hepatitis\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information about hepatitis, including\ncategories of hepatitis recognized for rating purposes\ndiagnostic testing required for hepatitis\ninterpreting lab reports for\nhepatitis B (HBV), and\nhepatitis C (HCV) after 1992\nrisk factors for HBV and HCV\ndevelopment for hepatitis risk factors\nconsidering drug abuse in hepatitis claims\nevaluating claims for increase for SC hepatitis awarded due to drug abuse\nconsidering in-service hepatitis findings\nrequesting exams and/or opinions for HBV or HCV\nreviewing hepatitis exams and opinions for sufficiency, and\nassigning a 0-percent evaluation for HCV.\nChange Date\nApril 21, 2025\nV.iii.6.3.a.Categories of Hepatitis Recognized for Rating Purposes\nThere are three main categories of viral hepatitis recognized for rating purposes.  The table below describes each type of hepatitis and explains the transmission and prognosis for each.\nType of Hepatitis\nTransmission\nPrognosis\nhepatitis A virus (HAV), previously called infectious hepatitis\nfecal-oral route\nAcute—seldom severe and does not leave residuals.\nNote:  In order to award SC, there must be evidence of chronic residuals related to the hepatitis A infection.\nhepatitis B virus (HBV), previously called serum hepatitis\nblood products\nsexual contact\nAcute in 90-95 percent of cases, but acute disease can be severe and result in death.\nChronic in 5-10 percent of cases.\nCirrhosis and liver cancer may develop.\nA vaccine to prevent HBV infection is available.\nhepatitis C virus (HCV), previously called non-A non-B hepatitis\ninfected blood\nClinically asymptomatic acute disease.\nChronic disease develops in 80 percent of cases following acute phase.\nDiagnosis is generally made incidentally many years later.\nNote:  Infectious hepatitis is common throughout the world and was especially prevalent during World War II following administration of the yellow fever vaccine in 1942 and in the Mediterranean Theater.\nReference:  For more information on risk factors for HBV and HCV, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 6.3.e.\nV.iii.6.3.b.Diagnostic Testing Required for Hepatitis\nSC for hepatitis requires blood serology testing to establish a diagnosis and identify the type of hepatitis present.  Liver function tests (LFTs) are necessary to assess the severity of the disease.\nNotes:\nThe rating decision should always specify the type of hepatitis for which SC is awarded.\nSerological tests determine the presence of antigens and antibodies to the specific virus.  The presence of antibodies to the specific virus indicates the infection is present.\nThe table below describes types of serological testing required to confirm a diagnosis for each type of hepatitis.\nType of Hepatitis\nSerology or Other Testing Required\nAdditional Notes\nHAV\nanti-HAV (antibodies to hepatitis A virus)\nAnti-HAV are present in the blood one month after the acute illness and persist for life.\nSerological blood testing showing the presence of anti-HAV indicates a past acute infection.\nHBV\nanti-HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) is present during the acute phase.\nHBsAg that persists more than three to six months indicates probable chronic disease or carrier status.\nA positive Australian antigen test is sufficient to confirm HBV.\nHBV has two antigens, a surface antigen and a core antigen\nHBsAg, and\nHBcAg (hepatitis B core antigen).\nConsequently, two types of antibodies appear in the blood\nanti-HBs (antibodies to the surface antigen), and\nanti-HBc (antibodies to the core antigen).\nHCV\nEIA (enzyme immunoassay) or ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, also called Western blot) is the first test.\nIf EIA or ELISA is positive, RIBA (recombinant immunoblot assay) is needed to confirm the diagnosis of chronic HCV.\nIn lieu of EIA/ELISA followed by RIBA, a positive test for HCV RNA (hepatitis C viral ribonucleic acid) is sufficient by itself to confirm a diagnosis of HCV.\nHCV RNA results can be\nqualitative (positive or negative), or\nquantitative (number of copies per milliliter (ml)).\nThe presence of anti-HCV (including EIA or ELISA) is not sufficient for a diagnosis of chronic HCV because it can be present in other diseases.\nNote:  Liver biopsy, ultrasound, and CT scan tests can detect damage to the liver but will not identify the type of infection.\nV.iii.6.3.c.Interpreting Lab Reports for HBV\nThe table below provides an example of a laboratory interpretation of serology test results for HBV.\nTest\nResults\nInterpretation\nExample 1\nHBsAg\nnegative\nsusceptible to infection\nanti-HBc\nnegative\nsusceptible to infection (no HBV)\nanti-HBs\nnegative\nno history of HBV\nExample 2\nHBsAg\nnegative\nimmune\nanti-HBc\nnegative or positive\nimmune\nanti-HBs\npositive\nExample 3\nHBsAg\npositive\nacute infection\nanti-HBc\npositive\nImmunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-HBc\npositive\nacute infection\nanti-HBs\nnegative\nExample 4\nHBsAg\npositive\nchronic infection\nanti-HBc\npositive\nIgM anti-HBc\nnegative\nchronic infection\nanti-HBs\nnegative\nV.iii.6.3.d.Interpreting Lab Reports for HCV After 1992\nThe table below provides an example of a laboratory interpretation of serology testing for HCV for testing performed after 1992.\nTests\nResults\nInterpretation\nanti-HCV\npositive (probable chronic hepatitis)\nneed to verify diagnosis\nEIA\npositive\nsupplemental test required\nRIBA\npositive\ndiagnostic\nHCVRNA\nfollow-up of chronic HCV\nnot needed for rating\nV.iii.6.3.e.  Risk Factors for HBV and HCV\nRisk factors for the development of HBV and HCV are similar.  The table below describes the medically recognized risk factors for HBV and HCV infection, provides transmission information concerning those risk factors, and includes tips for confirming the risk factors.\nNote:  Resolve reasonable doubt under 38 CFR 3.102 in favor of the Veteran when the evidence favoring risk factor(s) in service is equal to the evidence favoring risk factor(s) before or after service.\nRisk Factor\nTransmission Information\nRating Tips\ntransfusion of blood or blood product\nbefore 1992 for HCV, or\nbefore 1975 for HBV\norgan transplant before 1992, or\nhemodialysis\nBlood donor screening for HCV was not available until 1989 when HCV was identified.\nIn 1992, more effective screening of blood became possible for HCV.\nIf blood transfusion is a claimed risk factor, obtain the relevant hospital records from service, if possible.\nLook for evidence of blood transfusions in surgical reports, especially the\nanesthesia sheet\nsurgical record\noperative clinical records, or\npost-operative clinical notes.\ntattoos\nbody piercing, and\nacupuncture with non-sterile needles\ntransmitted through the use of unsterilized equipment\nReview for indications of tattoos or piercings on induction and separation exams to help determine whether tattooing or piercing took place in service.\nintravenous drug use\ntransmitted through the use of shared instruments\nRecords of drug treatment may reflect the type of drug abuse.\nhigh-risk sexual activity\nTransmission risk is relatively low but increases with multiple sexual partners.\nPeriodic health assessments or records of treatment for sexually transmitted diseases may document a history of high-risk sexual activity or multiple sexual partners.\nintranasal cocaine use\ntransmitted through the use of shared instruments\nRecords of drug treatment may reflect the type of drug abuse.\naccidental exposure to blood by percutaneous exposure or on mucous membranes\ncommon for the following:\nhealth care workers\ncombat medics, and\ncorpsmen\nConsider service department or other records reflecting occupational history.\nsharing of\ntoothbrushes, or\nshaving razors\ntransmitted through direct percutaneous exposure to blood\nThis type of in-service exposure will not generally be documented in service records. Consider buddy statements in the context of the entire evidence picture pertaining to risk factors.\nimmunization with a jet air gun injector\nonedocumented case of HBV transmission\nDespite the lack of any scientific evidence to document transmission of HCV with air gun injectors, it is biologically possible.\nA medical report linking hepatitis to air gun injectors must include a full discussion of all potential modes of transmission and a rationale as to why the examiner believes the air gun injector was the source for the hepatitis infection.\nReference:  For more information on development for and the concession of in-service risk factors associated with HCV, see Andrews v. McDonough, 34 Vet.App. 151 (2021).\nV.iii.6.3.f.Development for Hepatitis Risk Factors\nAs VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, does not inform the claimant to submit evidence of hepatitis risk factors, development for risk factors is required in every hepatitis claim, even when hepatitis is diagnosed in service.  Development is necessary to determine if pre- and post-service risk factors are present as well as to ensure that the risk factor is not substance abuse either before or during service.\nRegardless of what claim form the Veteran submits, development for risk factors is required if the complete risk factor history has not already been provided.  If risk factor history is not of record send a risk factor development letter to the Veteran.\nReferences:  For more information on\nSC for hepatitis associated with drug use, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 6.3.g, and\nexaminations and medical opinions in hepatitis claims, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 6.3.j.\nV.iii.6.3.g.Considering Drug Abuse in Hepatitis Claims\nIf one of the risk factors for hepatitis is intravenous or intramuscular drug use, or intranasal cocaine use, do not automatically assume the substance abuse is the cause of hepatitis and deny the claim on that basis.\nFollow the steps in the table below when considering a claim for SC for hepatitis in which injection drug or intranasal cocaine use is a confirmed in-service risk factor.\nStep\nAction\n1\nReview for all risk factors of hepatitis in addition to the drug use.\n2\nIf injection drug or intranasal cocaine use is the only confirmed in-service risk factor present, then deny SC. If other in-service risk factors are found in addition to injection drug or intranasal cocaine use, go to Step 3.\n3\nRequest a medical opinion to determine which confirmed in-service risk factor is at least as likely as not the cause of the hepatitis infection.\n4\nUse the table below to determine how to proceed with the medical opinion.\nIf the medical opinion …\nThen …\nstates that drug use is the cause of the hepatitis infection\ndeny the claim for SC for hepatitis.\ngives greater or equal weight to another confirmed in-service risk factor\nresolve reasonable doubt in the Veteran’s favor, and\naward SC.\nis unable to state which risk factor is more likely than not to be the cause of the hepatitis\nweigh all evidence, and\napply the reasonable doubt doctrine if the evidence is found to be in equipoise.\nReference:  For more information on examiner statements that an opinion would be speculative, see M21-1, Part IV, Subpart i, 3.A.1.q.\nReference:  For more information on considering claims for SC based on drug use, see\n38 CFR 3.301(c)(3), and\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart iv, 1.D.2.\nV.iii.6.3.h.﻿  Evaluating Claims for Increase for SC Hepatitis Awarded Due to Drug Abuse\nFollow the steps in the table below to determine the appropriate actions to take in a claim for increase when SC was previously awarded but the only apparent risk factor in service was drug abuse.\nStep\nAction\n1\nWas SC for hepatitis due to drug abuse awarded by rating decision on or before October 31, 1990?\nIf yes, then continue the finding of SC for hepatitis as the award of SC was proper based on regulations and procedures at that time. Go to Step 5.\nIf no, then go to Step 2.\n2\nDoes the evidence clearly show that the hepatitis is due to in-service drug abuse?\nIf yes, go to Step 4.\nIf no, go to Step 3.\n3\nIf SC was awarded but there is no evidence clearly linking the hepatitis to drug abuse or if there were multiple risk factors in service, one of which was drug abuse, and no prior opinion was obtained, request a medical opinion to determine whether the hepatitis is due to the drug abuse.\nIf the resulting opinion\nclearly links hepatitis to drug abuse, go to Step 4.\ncannot resolve whether hepatitis is due to drug abuse or another in-service risk factor, or the hepatitis is attributed to another non-drug abuse in-service risk factor, then\nresolve reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran and continue the finding of SC, and\naward an increased evaluation for hepatitis if the medical evidence otherwise shows the increase is warranted.\n4\nIf the evidence clearly shows that the hepatitis is due to in-service drug abuse and SC was awarded by rating decision after October 31, 1990, determine whether the award of SC is protected per 38 CFR 3.957.\nIf SC. is protected, go to Step 5.\nIf SC is not protected, then propose to sever SC per 38 CFR 3.105(a).\n5\nIf SC was properly established for hepatitis due to drug abuse by rating decision on or before October 31, 1990, and/or if the award of SC for hepatitis is protected, do not award an increased evaluation for hepatitis due to drug abuse.\nNotes:\nThe Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-508 Section 8052) prohibited the grant of SC for disability or death resulting from alcohol or drug abuse for claims filed after October 31, 1990.\nVAOPGCPREC 2-1998 found that an increased evaluation may not be awarded when SC was previously properly established as due to drug abuse by rating decision on or before October 31, 1990.\nV.iii.6.3.i.Considering In-Service Hepatitis Findings\nWhen a Veteran submits a claim for SC of hepatitis, assess the lay evidence, service treatment records (STRs), and current medical records to ascertain whether a current disability, an in-service event or injury, and an indication of an association are present as required in 38 CFR 3.159(c)(4) prior to requesting examination and/or medical opinion.\nUse the table below to determine the proper rating action for in-service findings related to hepatitis.\nIf STRs show ...\nThen ...\ndiagnosis of non-specific hepatitis and SC is claimed many years later\nrequest an exam with serology testing and LFTs (if not already of record) and opinion to determine if a relationship exists between the episode of hepatitis in service and the current type of hepatitis unless there is sufficient evidence of a clearly-established diagnosis and continuous symptoms present to satisfy the nexus standard under 38 CFR 3.303(b).\nlaboratory findings confirming HAV or HBV\nSC for HAV is not warranted as HAV is an acute condition.\nConsider SC for HBV if a chronic disability is present and linked to the in-service finding and/or risk factors.\nConsider SC for HCV if a medical opinion links the condition to the confirmed in-service findings and/or risk factors.  However, do not automatically grant SC for HCV.  The lab findings in service alone do not show HCV in service or allow a conclusion that HCV was incurred in service.  Each type of hepatitis can be acquired at different times and through different means.\na diagnosis of non-A, non-B hepatitis (old name for HCV) and the current medical evidence confirms a diagnosis of HCV\nSC is likely warranted.\nIf medical evidence establishes the presence of continuous symptoms since service, then award SC.\nIf evidence of continuous symptoms since service is not present, request a nexus opinion.\nnon-specific hepatitis and current evidence shows HCV or chronic HBV only\nHCV or chronic HBV may warrant SC based on reasonable doubt. Request a medical opinion and any necessary diagnostic testing to confirm the diagnosis.\nReference:  For more information on diagnostic testing required for hepatitis, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 6.3.b.\nnon-specific hepatitis and current evidence shows HCV orchronic HBV as well as a history of HAV\na medical opinion is necessary to determine whether the current disability is a result of the non-specific hepatitis diagnosed in service.\nV.iii.6.3.j.Requesting Exams and/or Opinions for HBV or HCV\nFollow the steps in the table below when requesting an examination and/or opinion for HCV or chronic HBV.\nStep\nAction\n1\nIdentify and request the examiner review of all relevant evidence in the claims folder.\n2\nList any risk factors identified by the Veteran.\n3\nIdentify all risk factors confirmed by the evidence in the claims folder, whether claimed by the Veteran or not.\nImportant:  In addition to in-service risk factors, ensure that all documented pre- and post-service risk factors are noted in the exam request.\n4\nRequest Hepatitis, Cirrhosis And Other Liver Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire.\n5\nRequest a medical opinion about the relationship between the current HBV or HCV infection and confirmed or supported risk factor(s).\n6\nNotify the examiner that a positive nexus opinion, if warranted, should take only confirmed risk factors as shown by the objective evidence of record into consideration.\nReferences:  For more information on\nconfirming risk factors, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 6.3.e, and\nevaluating evidence, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 1.A.\nV.iii.6.3.k.Reviewing Hepatitis Exams and Opinions for Sufficiency\nReview the examination or opinion to ensure sufficiency and return insufficient examinations when warranted.  Common reasons for insufficient examinations are\nlack of proper confirmatory testing to support the diagnosis\nfailure to include complete clinical findings and symptoms in the report\nfailure to address all known risk factors in the opinion\nopinions linking HCV or chronic HBV to a risk factor that is not confirmed in the evidence of record, and\nopinions improperly linking HCV or chronic HBV to a risk factor that is not medically recognized as a source of infection.\nV.iii.6.3.l.Assigning a 0-Percent Evaluation for HCV\nTo assign an evaluation for HCV (38 CFR 4.114, DC 7354) use the criteria in 38 CFR 4.114, DC 7345 (chronic liver disease without cirrhosis).\nA 0-percent evaluation should only be assigned for HCV when the condition is asymptomatic with a previous history of liver disease.\nUse the table below to determine when it is appropriate to assign a 0-percent evaluation for HCV.\nIf medical evidence shows ...\nThen a 0-percent disability evaluation is ...\neven mild symptoms related to HCV infection\nnot appropriate because the Veteran is symptomatic.\nthere is evidence of liver damage on LFTs, liver biopsy, or other testing\nnot appropriate because this means the infection is not healed.\nHCV has responded to therapy to the extent that RNA test results are negative, and the Veteran is now asymptomatic with no evidence of liver damage\nappropriate. However, HCV remains dormant in the system and may flare up again later.\nReference:  For more information on evaluation of HCV, see 38 CFR 4.114, DC 7354.\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, Chapter 7 - Genitourinary Disabilities\nArticle ID: 554400000180593\nUpdated Sep 30, 2025\n<-- Previous Section Next Section -->\nOverview\nIn This Chapter\nThis chapter contains the following topics:\nTopic\nTopic Name\n1\nGeneral Rating Principles for Genitourinary Disabilities\n2\nEvaluating Nephritis and Nephropathy\n3\nProstate Conditions\n4\nErectile Dysfunction (ED)\n5\nOther Genitourinary Considerations\n1.  General Rating Principles for Genitourinary Disabilities\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains guidance on the general principles for evaluating genitourinary dysfunction, including\nrating genitourinary disorders\nrenal dysfunction\ndetermining the chronicity of renal dysfunction\nuse of catheters and other appliances\nurinary tract infection\nrecurrent stone formation, and\nchanges in the rating schedule for the genitourinary system.\nChange Date\nNovember 15, 2021\nV.iii.7.1.a.  Rating Genitourinary Disorders\nThe diagnostic codes (DCs) for genitourinary disorders are at 38 CFR 4.115b.  Many of those are rated by the rating formulas for dysfunction provided in 38 CFR 4.115a.  The three types of genitourinary dysfunction are\nvoiding dysfunction, which provides evaluations based on\nfrequency\nleakage, and/or\nobstructed voiding\nurinary tract infections, and\nrenal dysfunction.\n38 CFR 4.115a provides that diseases of the genitourinary system generally result in disabilities related to renal or voiding dysfunctions, infections, or a combination of these.\nWhere a particular DC lists more than one dysfunction under which the condition can be rated, only the predominant area of dysfunction shall be utilized for rating purposes.  Separate evaluations may not be assigned for different types of dysfunction attributable to a single condition.\nWhen different genitourinary conditions are present and each is evaluated using a different type of dysfunction, separate evaluations may be assigned.\nWhen different genitourinary conditions are present but each is evaluated using the same type of dysfunction, separate evaluations may not be assigned.\nImportant:\nEnsure in every case that rating decisions not pyramid or separate individual findings when those findings in their entirety constitute one disability as discussed at M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.D.2.b.\n38 CFR 4.115a acknowledges that since the areas of dysfunction do not cover all symptoms resulting from genitourinary diseases, specific diagnoses may include a description of symptoms assigned to that diagnosis.\nExample:  For pyelonephritis, 38 CFR 4.115b, DC 7504 directs to rate as renal dysfunction or urinary tract infection, whichever is predominant.  If symptoms of both renal dysfunction and urinary tract infection are present and associated with pyelonephritis, assign a single evaluation based on the most disabling symptoms.\nV.iii.7.1.b.  Renal Dysfunction\nRenal dysfunction is evaluated using specific, objective laboratory findings.\nGlomerular filtration rate (GFR) is widely accepted as the best overall measure of kidney function in health and disease.  There is an inverse correlation between GFR and functional impairment.\nLower GFRs correspond to greater impairment.\nIndividuals with GFRs less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 are considered to have chronic renal disease.\nA GFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 is a sign of renal failure.\nGFR, estimated GFR (eGFR), and creatinine-based approximations are acceptable for evaluation purposes, as each has been shown to be an adequate indicator of the stage of chronic kidney disease.  Elevated creatinine levels are correlated with decreasing GFR.\nProteinuria, as measured by increased urinary excretion of albumin, is an early and sensitive maker of kidney damage and is reflected by an albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) of 30 mg/g or greater.\nV.iii.7.1.c.  Determining Chronicity of Renal Dysfunction\nAssignment of a compensable evaluation for renal dysfunction based on abnormal GFR or (other findings accepted for evaluation purposes under 38 CFR 4.115a) is premised upon findings spanning over three consecutive  months.\nSatisfaction of the three-month requirement does not necessitate an individual finding in each month of a three-month period.  Rather, clinical data showing an abnormal finding with another repeated abnormal finding 3 or more months later during a 12-month period will document chronicity of the impairment and will be sufficient to satisfy this requirement unless there is evidence to the contrary.\nIt is expected that an individual with chronic renal dysfunction would be followed for treatment and clinical data would be sufficient to document chronicity of findings over the three month or longer period.\nHowever, when such clinical data is unavailable to decision makers, a one-time finding may be used to assign the corresponding disability evaluation unless there is evidence that suggests non-chronicity of the impairment.\nWhen a compensable evaluation is assigned based on a one-time finding of abnormal GFR, defer the end product and schedule an at-once examination to obtain a second GFR reading three months after the first.\nThis at-once examination is necessary to satisfy the regulatory requirement for sustained findings from a three-month period.\nReference:  For more information on handling improvement shown on the at-once examination, see\n38 CFR 3.105(e), and\nM21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 4.A.\nV.iii.7.1.d.  Use of Catheters and Other Appliances\nThe term appliance, as used in the criteria for voiding dysfunction under 38 CFR 4.115a, includes all types of catheters, as well as any other assistive device for urination.\nImportant:  Appliances, including catheters, may be used to treat urine leakage associated with voiding dysfunction and/or urine retention associated with obstructed voiding.  The rating activity should review the evidence carefully to determine whether the appliance is required to treat urine leakage or urine retention and evaluate on the predominant disability.\nNote:  For the purposes of evaluating urinary tract infection at the 30-percent rate, the use of catheters is not considered comparable to drainage by stent or nephrostomy and is inconsistent with the remainder of the criteria required for a 30-percent evaluation.  Stent and nephrostomy tube insertion are surgical procedures and require more intensive management than drainage by catheterization.\nExample 1:  A Veteran is service-connected (SC) for a bladder injury.  Medical records show a catheter is required for urine leakage due to the bladder injury.\nResult:  A 60-percent evaluation should be assigned for this disability based on voiding dysfunction.\nExample 2:  A Veteran is SC for a bladder injury. Medical records show a catheter is required for urine retention due to the bladder injury.\nResult:  A 30-percent evaluation should be assigned for this disability based on obstructed voiding.\nReference:  For more information on ratings of the genitourinary system based on voiding dysfunction, see 38 CFR 4.115a.\nV.iii.7.1.e.  Urinary Tract Infection\nThe following terms are utilized in the criteria for evaluating urinary tract infection.\nSuppressive drug therapy, as identified in the criteria for the 0- and 10-percent disability evaluations, refers to the use of prolonged suppressive antibiotic therapy or medications for treatment of urinary tract infections.  The required duration of the therapy is identified in the rating criteria.\nContinuous intensive management, as identified in the criteria for the 30-percent disability evaluation, refers to the requirement for treatment beyond the use of antibiotic or other medications or hospitalizations as described in the 0- and 10-percent evaluation levels.  Examples of this level of care include but are not limited surgical management of the nephrostomy and/or stent, intravenous antibiotics, or treatment that is otherwise required for the maintenance of the nephrostomy tube or stent.\nV.iii.7.1.f.  Recurrent Stone Formation\nUnder 38 CFR 4.115b, DC 7508, a 30-percent disability evaluation is assigned when evidence shows recurrent stone formation requiring invasive or non-invasive procedures more than 2 times per year.\nExamples of therapeutic procedures that would satisfy these requirements include (but are not limited to)\ninvasive procedures, such as\nopen surgical lithotomy\npercutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL)\nretrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), or\nother minimally invasive endourological treatments, and\nnon-invasive procedures, such as\nshockwave lithotripsy (SWL), or\nureteroscopic fragmentation and retrieval.\nRecurrent stone formation means that there must be more than one episode of stone formation requiring treatment during a one-year period.\nV.iii.7.1.g.  Changes in the Rating Schedule for the Genitourinary System\nThe rating criteria for the genitourinary system have undergone historical changes.  Recent full-scale revisions were effective on the following dates:\nNovember 14, 2021, and\nFebruary 17, 1994.\nNote:  These changes in the rating criteria\nare not considered liberalizing, and\nshould not be the basis for a reduction in disability rating unless medical evidence establishes that the disability has actually improved.\n2.  Evaluating Nephritis and Nephropathy\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information about general principles for rating genitourinary disabilities, including\ndefinition of nephropathy\nevaluating nephropathy\nevaluation of nephropathy and hypertension\ndefinition of nephritis\ncharacteristics of nephritis\nevaluating nephritis\nlimits on separate evaluation of nephritis and cardiovascular conditions, and\ndistinguishing nephritis from other types of nephropathy.\nChange Date\nNovember 15, 2021\nV.iii.7.2.a.  Definition:  Nephropathy\nNephropathy is generally defined as a condition encompassing disease or damage of the kidneys.  Nephropathy is a broader term to describe any condition that impairs renal function. Examples of nephropathy include (but are not limited to) chronic renal disease, nephrotic syndrome, and nephritis.\nV.iii.7.2.b.  Evaluating Nephropathy\nFor Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability purposes, nephropathy is evaluated as renal dysfunction under 38 CFR 4.115a.\nThe most commonly used DC for nephropathy is 38 CFR 4.115b, DC 7541, “renal involvement in diabetes mellitus type I or II,” otherwise known as diabetic nephropathy.\nImportant:  When the renal impairment is a form of nephritis, 38 CFR 4.115applies as discussed in M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 7.2.f.\nV.iii.7.2.c.  Evaluation of Nephropathy and Hypertension\nThe provision of 38 CFR 4.115 that states that separate ratings are not to be assigned for disability from disease of the heart and any form of nephritis does not apply when evaluating other types of nephropathy because nephropathy is a broader diagnostic classification warranting its own evaluative approach.  Other types of nephropathy may be assigned separate evaluations for the renal impairment and heart disease and/or hypertension.\nNote:  Prior to the revision of 38 CFR 4.115a effective on November 14, 2021, hypertension was included among the criteria for evaluation of renal dysfunction.  Consequently, under the historical criteria, separate evaluations could not be assigned for hypertension and nephropathy except when dialysis was required or when the condition was characterized by absence of the kidney as assignment of separate evaluations would have been in violation of 38 CFR 4.14.\nReference:  For more information on the historical prohibition against separate evaluations for hypertension and nephropathy in place prior to November 14, 2021, see\n38 CFR 4.14, and\nthe attachment titled Historical_M21-1V_iii_7_9-15-21.\nV.iii.7.2.d.  Definition:  Nephritis\nNephritis is generally defined as inflammation of the kidneys.  It includes inflammation of any renal structure such as glomeruli, tubules, or interstitial tissue. Nephritis is a form of nephropathy.\nV.iii.7.2.e.  Characteristics of Nephritis\n38 CFR 4.115 discusses several medical concepts pertaining to nephritis. These concepts may be useful in determining when the duty to assist requires an examination or opinion or when medical results may need clarification.\nCharacteristics of glomerular nephritis\nUsually preceded by or associated with severe infectious disease.\nSudden onset.\nCourse marked by red blood cells, salt retention, and edema.\nMay clear up entirely or progress to a chronic condition.\nCharacteristics of nephrosclerotic nephritis\nOriginating in hypertension or arteriosclerosis.\nDevelops slowly.\nMinimum laboratory findings.\nAssociated with natural progress.\nAlbuminuria alone is not nephritis.\nDo not accept the presence of transient symptoms, such as elevated albumin and the presence of casts following febrile illness as establishing nephritis.\nV.iii.7.2.f. Evaluating Nephritis\nChronic nephritis is addressed in 38 CFR 4.115b, DC 7502.  It is rated as renal dysfunction under 38 CFR 4.115a.  Glomerulonephritis (38 CFR 4.115b, DC 7536) and interstitial nephritis (38 CFR 4.115b, DC 7537) also use the renal dysfunction criteria.\nNote:  When nephrosclerosis arises from nephritis, the evaluation criteria under 38 CFR 4.115b, DC 7507 directs that\nnephrosclerosis be rated according to the predominant symptoms as\nrenal dysfunction\nhypertension, or\nheart disease, and\nif nephrosclerosis is rated under the cardiovascular schedule, the rating which would otherwise be assigned will be elevated to the next higher level.\nV.iii.7.2.g.  Limits on Separate Evaluation of Nephritis and Cardiovascular Conditions\n38 CFR 4.115 states that separate ratings cannot be assigned for disability from disease of the heart and any form of nephritis.\nThe rationale is that there is a close interrelationship between cardiovascular disabilities and nephritis.\nExample 1:  The following separate evaluations are not permitted under 38 CFR 4.115 even if the nephritis evaluation was supportable based on definite decrease in renal function.\n7101\nHypertension\n10\n7502\nNephritis\n60\nExceptions:  Separate ratings for any hypertension or heart disease are permitted in the following scenarios:\nchronic renal disease has progressed to the point where regular dialysis is required, or\nif absence of a kidney is the sole renal disability, even if removal was required because of nephritis.\nExample 2:  The following separate evaluations are allowed since absence of the kidney is the sole renal disability.\n7500\nKidney – removal of one, history of glomerulonephritis\n30\n7101\nHypertension\n20\nExample 3:  The following separate evaluations are allowed if the 100-percent evaluation for nephritis is based on the requirement for dialysis.\n7530\nNephritis\n100\n7101\nHypertension\n10\nReference:  For more information on nephritis, including the different types of nephritis, see\n38 CFR 4.115, and\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 7.2.f.\nV.iii.7.2.h.  Distinguishing Nephritis From Other Types of Nephropathy\nAlthough a condition may be diagnosed as nephropathy, the evidence must be carefully examined to determine if the diagnosed nephropathy can be clinically recognized as a form of nephritis that would trigger 38 CFR 4.115 application.\nA nephropathy diagnosis is not dispositive for the purpose of making this distinction.\nAdditional review of the evidence beyond the given diagnosis will be necessary to determine whether the renal condition, irrespective of the diagnosis, is a form of nephritis.\nIn the following examples, the diagnosis contains the term “nephropathy” but the disability is actually a type of nephritis and must be evaluated with consideration of 38 CFR 4.115.\nIgA nephropathy is generally characterized clinically as a type of primary glomerulonephritis.\n38 CFR 4.115b, DC 7537 is the DC for interstitial nephritis, and gouty nephropathy is identified as a type of interstitial nephritis as well as other disorders of calcium metabolism.\nImportant:\nWhen the clinical evidence is unclear, request a medical opinion to determine whether the disability in question is a type of nephritis.\nIt is impermissible to evaluate a type of nephritis specifically identified in the rating schedule, such as gouty nephropathy, by analogy in an effort to achieve a higher disability evaluation.\n3.  Prostate Conditions\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information about prostate conditions, including\nbenign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH)\ndiagnosis of prostate cancer by biopsy\nrating prostate cancer, and\nED and special monthly compensation (SMC) due to prostate cancer.\nChange Date\nJune 14, 2019\nV.iii.7.3.a.  BPH\nBenign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) is evaluated under 38 CFR 4.115b, DC 7527based on associated voiding dysfunction or urinary tract infection, but can be evaluated as renal dysfunction when applicable.  Consider the following when rating BPH:\nBPH and some types of treatment for BPH, such as alpha blocker drugs, finasteride, or balloon dilation, can cause incontinence.\nRetrograde ejaculation can result from some types of BPH treatment, especially transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).\nSpecial monthly compensation (SMC) (k) may be warranted if there is associated erectile dysfunction (ED) or retrograde ejaculation as a result of treatment or if hormone therapy is used.  SMC entitlement is determined on a factual basis.\nV.iii.7.3.b.Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer by Biopsy\nA diagnosis of prostate cancer is made only on the basis of a prostate biopsy.  An elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is not diagnostic of cancer.\nException:  A prostate biopsy is not required to support a medical diagnosis that prostate cancer has recurred after radical prostatectomy.\nWhen the initial diagnosis of prostate cancer was confirmed by biopsy and the evidence shows recurrence following any type of treatment, repeat biopsy is not required.\nThe fact that the diagnosis of recurrence considered PSA does not make the assessment insufficient for rating purposes.  An assessment should, however, be based on more than PSA results such as, but not limited to, other clinical findings, reports of symptoms, or other medical evidence\nV.iii.7.3.c. Rating Prostate Cancer\nThe table below describes common treatments for prostate cancer as well as the side effects and rating considerations associated with the treatment.\nType of Treatment\nPotential Side Effects\nRating Considerations\nWatchful waiting\nalso called\nconservative management\nobservation, or\nsurveillance, and\nno immediate specific therapy is being used, but cancer is active.\nNone, except for the continued presence and potential metastasis of cancer\noften used when life expectancy is short due to age or other illness since prostate cancer is slow- growing.\nReview to confirm the continuation of active cancer previously confirmed by biopsy.\nEvaluate at 100 percent, despite the lack of treatment and possible lack of symptoms.\nNote:  If watchful waiting is used to closely monitor inactive cancer that is in remission, evaluate based on residuals since the cancer is no longer active.\nRadical prostatectomy surgery which\nis characterized by removal of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles\nis the most common treatment for localized cancer\ncan be curative, and\nmay involve a nerve-sparing procedure to improve chances that the patient will retain normal erectile function.\nImpotence, and/or\nincontinence.\nIn all cases of radical prostatectomy, award SMC (k) for loss of use (LOU) of a creative organ.\nConsider service connection (SC) for ED on a facts-found basis.\nCryotherapy, also known as cryosurgery or cryoablation, is a procedure by which the prostate and nearby tissues are frozen with liquid nitrogen via probes in the perineum.\nImpotence\nincontinence\nurethral scarring, and\nrectourethral fistula (rare).\nConsider SMC (k) on a facts-found basis.\nRadiation\ncan be curative if cancer is confined to the prostate and surrounding tissues and PSA is 15 nanograms (ng)/ml or less\nis also used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms of advanced cancer, such as bone pain due to metastasis, and\ncan be\ninternal radiation therapy, or brachytherapy, in which radioactive seeds are implanted in the prostate, including\nhigh dose radiation (HDR) in which seeds are implanted for less than a day and then removed, and radiation is present only while seeds are in place, or\nlow dose radiation (LDR) in which seeds are permanently implanted and give off radiation for weeks to months, depending on the radioisotope used, or\nexternal radiation therapy, in which radiation is delivered by high-energy eternal radiation for six to eight weeks.\nAfter external beam radiation\nimpotence, and/or\nincontinence, and\nafter brachytherapy\nimpotence\nincontinence\nbowel problems, and/or\nurethral complications.\nAfter internal HDR\nthe radiation continues only for hours or days, so a six-month assignment of temporary 100-percent under 38 CFR 4.115b, DC 7528 is appropriate, and\nconsider SMC (k) for impotence on a facts-found basis.\nAfter internal LDR\nthe effective radiation should be gone by one year\nassign a 100-percent evaluation for one year, and\nschedule a review exam six months following the cessation of the one-year treatment period.\nNote:  If radiation is used only as palliative therapy in advanced cancer, the 100-percent evaluation will continue because the cancer will remain active.  Therefore\nreview for metastatic disease, and\nconsider permanency.\nHormone therapy is primarily for palliation of prostate cancer which is not confined to the prostate for the purpose of testosterone deprivation.\nTypes of hormone therapy include\norchiectomy, the removal of testes to prevent testosterone production\nluteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists (LHRH analogs), which can lower the testosterone as effectively as orchiectomy such as\nLupron (leuprolide)\nZoladex (goserelin), and\nbusrelin\nestrogens or estrogen-like drugs, which lower the level of testosterone\nsecond-line hormonal drugs, which are used when first-line hormone therapy fails\nanti-androgens, which block the ability of the body to use androgens, such as\nEulexin (flutamide)\nCasodex (bicalutamide), and\nNilandron (nilutamide), and\ncombined hormone therapy, which is an anti-androgen combined with orchiectomy or an LHRH agonist (analog).\nAfter any hormone therapy\nhot flashes\nosteoporosis\nloss of muscle mass\nafter orchiectomy\nimpotence\nsterility\nloss of sex drive\nafter anti-androgen therapy\ngastrointestinal upset\nbreast tenderness\ngynecomastia\ndecreased libido\nimpotence\nhot flashes, and\nafter LHRH analogs\nimpotence\nhot flashes, and\ngynecomastia.\nOrchiectomy results in anatomical loss of a creative organ; therefore\nevaluate under 38 CFR 4.115b, DC 7524, and\naward SMC.\nHormone therapy may continue for many years; therefore\nreview treatment records for expected duration of treatment, and\nconsider permanence.\nChemotherapy\nDepending on the type of chemotherapy used, there are multiple possible side effects.\nChemotherapy is used for palliation as current agents will not eradicate prostate cancer; therefore\nevaluate as 100 percent\nconsider permanence\nreview for metastatic disease, and\nif metastatic disease affects body systems other than the genitourinary system, award a separate evaluation for confirmed metastatic disease under the appropriate code for that body system.\nReferences:  For more information on\nassigning staged evaluations for prostate cancer. see\nTatum v. Shinseki, 24 Vet.App 139, 141 (2010)\nM21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 8.D.3.e and f, and\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.D.2.j\nconsidering entitlement to SC for ED and SC for LOU of a creative organ associated with prostate cancer, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 7.3.d, and\nevaluating cancer and its residuals, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.D.5.a and b.\nV.iii.7.3.d. ED and SMC Due to Prostate Cancer\nSC for prostate cancer does not automatically result in\nSC for ED, or\nentitlement to SMC (k).\nThere are various treatments for prostate cancer, such as hormonal therapy, that may result in ED.  Refer to M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 7.3.c for more information about specific types of treatment and the associated side effects, such as ED or LOU of a creative organ.\nNote:  General guidelines under 38 CFR 3.400 should be followed when determining the effective date for ED.  If ED is the basis for SMC (k), the effective date for the SMC will generally coincide with the date SC is awarded for ED.\nException:  Radical prostatectomy is a special case.  In all cases where prostate cancer is treated with radical prostatectomy, award entitlement to SMC (k) for LOU of a creative organ without additional examination or medical opinion.\nRadical prostatectomy results in loss of ejaculatory power and will warrant SMC (k) from the date of the procedure, assuming that the Veteran is already SC for prostate cancer from that date.\nEntitlement to SC for ED associated with the radical prostatectomy is a separate factual determination.  For the purposes of determining SMC entitlement following radical prostatectomy, it is irrelevant whether ED also exists at the time the SMC is awarded.\nReference:  For more information on when SMC is warranted for ED and other sexual dysfunction, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 7.4.b.\n4.  ED\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information about ED, including\nED\nSMC associated with ED or other sexual dysfunction\nED associated with systemic disease, and\nscars associated with ED.\nChange Date\nNovember 15, 2021\nV.iii.7.4.a. ED\nED is evaluated with a noncompensable evaluation under 38 CFR 4.115b, DC 7522 without regard to whether penile deformity is present.\nReference:  For more information on evaluating deformity of the penis under the version of the rating schedule in effect prior to November 14, 2021, see Williams v. Wilkie, 30 Vet.App. 134 (2018).\nV.iii.7.4.b.Entitlement to SMC Associated With ED or Other Sexual Dysfunction\nGrant SMC (k) when the evidence shows that SC ED constitutes LOU of a creative organ.  Other diagnoses of sexual dysfunction that may result in LOU include (but are not limited to) loss of libido, loss of sexual drive, or impotence.\nWhen a VA examiner finds that there is ED or other sexual dysfunction, SMC (k) is established even though\nthe Veteran can achieve erection and penetration with the use of medication, or\nthe Veteran had a vasectomy prior to the development of the LOU of a creative organ, as vasectomies may be reversible while LOU is not.\nWhen the evidence, including an examination report or other medical information, shows that a diagnosis of ED or other sexual dysfunction is present but indicates that the Veteran can penetrate and ejaculate without the use of medication, resolve reasonable doubt in the Veteran’s favor and interpret the report to establish that LOU of a creative organ is present and grant entitlement to SMC (k).\nException:  Do not establish SMC(k) based on an examiner’s finding/conclusion that there is ED if\nthe examination is insufficient for rating purposes because it is not supported by a valid rationale and/or by the evidence of record (for example if the examiner checks that there is ED but there is no history, examination or other basis for the finding)\nthe report is based on the claimant’s report of ED but there is some specific evidence that the claimant’s account of ED lacks credibility, or\nthe preponderance (greater weight) of the evidence proves the contrary.\nReferences:  For more information on\nentitlement to SMC (k) for LOU of a creative organ, see\n38 CFR 3.350(a)(1), and\nM21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 4.A.4\nentitlement to SMC (k) associated with radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer, see\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 7.3.d, and\nM21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 4.A.4.c\nevaluating ED, see 38 CFR 4.115b, DC 7522, and\ninsufficient examination reports, see M21-1, Part IV, Subpart i, 3.C, and\nprocedures for evaluating evidence, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 1.A.\nV.iii.7.4.c.  ED Associated With Systemic Disease\nWhen evaluating residuals of a systemic disease process such as multiple sclerosis or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and associated ED, award SC for ED and assign a separate evaluation for the ED when it is otherwise appropriate to separately evaluate residuals.\nException:  Noncompensable complications of diabetes mellitus must be evaluated with the disease process as provided in 38 CFR 4.119, DC 7913.\nReference:  For more information on the assignment of a separate evaluation for ED associated with systemic disease processes, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 12.C.\nV.iii.7.4.d.  Scars Associated With ED\nEvaluations for ED assigned under 38 CFR 4.115b, DC 7522 account for the functional impairment arising from disease or traumatic injury.  Evaluation under this DC does not preclude a separate evaluation for non-functional impairment, such as painful scarring, under 38 CFR 4.118 when otherwise warranted.\n5.  Other Genitourinary Considerations\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information about other genitourinary considerations, including\nresiduals of venereal disease or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related illness\nkidney donation\nhydrocele and varicocele, and\ninfertility.\nChange Date\nSeptember 30, 2025\nV.iii.7.5.a.Residuals of Venereal Disease or HIV-Related Illness\nDo not consider specific residuals of venereal disease or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related illness to be the result of willful misconduct.\nDetermine SC for residuals of venereal disease or HIV-related illness by the same general principles applicable to resolution of the issue of SC for other diseases.\nReferences:  For more information on\nwillful misconduct and venereal disease, see 38 CFR 3.301(c)(1)\nconsidering claims for SC of human papillomavirus infection (HPV), see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 8.A.2.f, and\ndisability or death from use of drugs, see M21-1, Part X, Subpart iv, 1.D.\nV.iii.7.5.b.  Kidney Donation\nKidney donation and any expected residual effects thereof are not subject to SC. Kidney donation is considered an elective surgery, and therefore, does not meet the provisions of a disease or injury incurred coincident with service.\nReference:  For more information about the principles relating to SC, see\n38 CFR 3.303, and\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 2.A.\nV.iii.7.5.c.  Hydrocele and Varicocele\nHydrocele is a collection of fluid in the scrotum.\nVaricocele is a dilatation of the veins along the cord that receives blood from the testicles.\nThese conditions may be associated with a decrease in fertility and, in rare instances, may be associated with infertility.  In instances where there is a clinical finding of infertility which is linked to the hydrocele or varicocele, entitlement to SMC is warranted.\nV.iii.7.5.d.Infertility\nInfertility, as defined in M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.C, 4.a, can be a symptom or consequence of injury or disease.  If a Veteran claims SC for infertility, rate the underlying injury or disease under the appropriate DC.  Do not establish SC for infertility itself.\nSMC due to anatomical loss or LOU of a creative organ is warranted if there is an SC condition resulting in infertility.\nReferences:  For

Chapter 8, Section A - Disabilities of the Gynecological System\nArticle ID: 554400000180511\nUpdated Sep 30, 2025\n<-- Previous Section Next Section -->\nOverview\nIn This Section\nThis section contains the following topics:\nTopic\nTopic Name\n1\nFemale Sexual Arousal Disorder (FSAD)\n2\nOther Gynecological Disorders\n1.  Female Sexual Arousal Disorder (FSAD)\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information about evaluating FSAD, including\ndefinition of FSAD\nrequesting examinations for FSAD claims\nwithin scope determinations for FSAD\nevaluating FSAD, and\nconsidering special monthly compensation (SMC) associated with FSAD.\nChange Date\nMay 19, 2020\nV.iii.8.A.1.a.Definition:  FSAD\nFemale Sexual Arousal Disorder (FSAD) refers to the continual or recurrent physical inability of a woman to accomplish or maintain an ample lubrication-swelling reaction during sexual intercourse.  Decreased blood flow to the genital area is believed to contribute to FSAD similar to the role of vascular disease in male erectile dysfunction.  Other causes may include nerve and/or tissue damage.\nImportant:\nFSAD is a physical disorder characterized by physiological findings/damage to the gynecological system.  It is not a psychiatric condition found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fifth version (DSM-5) for mental disorders.  DSM-5 does include a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder, which is a different disorder and is not synonymous with FSAD.\nA diagnosis of FSAD cannot be rendered or confirmed by a mental health examiner.  When a mental health examination or mental health treatment records suggest a diagnosis of FSAD, including FSAD secondary to medication for a psychiatric disorder, the diagnosis must be confirmed in other medical evidence by a qualified medical professional.\nV.iii.8.A.1.b.Requesting Examinations for FSAD Claims\nUse the Gynecological Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire when a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) examination is necessary to assist in substantiating a claim of FSAD or other female sexual dysfunction.\nNotes:\nIf the Veteran claims service connection (SC) for FSAD or other sexual dysfunction and the exam threshold described in 38 CFR 3.159(c)(4) is met, request the examination using the Gynecological Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire.\nThe Gynecological Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire includes a specific section concerning FSAD that includes a request for the examiner to identify whether\nthe Veteran has FSAD, and\nFSAD, if present, is at least as likely as not attributable to another condition.\nIn all cases, if an examiner diagnoses FSAD, the Gynecological Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire must be completed, or sufficient alternative evidence (such as private medical evidence submitted in lieu of an examination) must be of record.\nWhen a claimed gynecological issue is examined using an examination other than the Gynecological Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire, such as an examination of scars following cesarean section using the Scars/Disfigurement Disability Benefits Questionnaire, also request the Gynecological Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire to evaluate the underlying gynecological issue, including FSAD.\nV.iii.8.A.1.c.  Within Scope Determinations for FSAD\nIf SC for FSAD is not expressly claimed, consider FSAD within scope of the claim in the circumstances described in the table below.\nWhen ...\nThen consider FSAD within scope of the ...\nthe Gynecological Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaireindicates that FSAD is attributable to the claimed gynecological disorder\nclaimed gynecological disorder.\nNote:  When a gynecological disorder is claimed, the examiner must address whether FSAD is present and if it is related to the claimed gynecological disorder as noted in M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 8.A.1.b.\na mental health examination indicates a diagnosis of FSAD is present and provides possible nexus information linking it to medication or treatment for a mental health disorder\nclaimed mental health condition.\nNote:  The diagnosis of FSAD must be confirmed by an appropriate non-mental health examiner.  Analyze the evidence of record to determine whether the criteria under 38 CFR 3.159(c)(4) are satisfied to request further examination of FSAD.\nother evidence submitted with the claim leads to a within scope determination for FSAD as described at M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.A.2.c\nclaimed condition.\nV.iii.8.A.1.d.Evaluating FSAD\nWhen the requirements are met, SC for FSAD will be awarded as a stand-alone gynecological disability using 38 CFR 4.116, diagnostic code (DC) 7632 with a 0-percent evaluation.  This is the maximum evaluation available for FSAD.\nNote:  The original clarification that FSAD is a disorder subject to SC was not a regulatory change.  Consequently, the provisions of 38 CFR 3.114 do not apply for assignment of the effective date.  Subsequent updates to 38 CFR 4.116, including the addition of DC 7632 for FSAD, effective May 13, 2018, are, similarly, not liberalizing.\nV.iii.8.A.1.e.  Considering SMC Associated With FSAD\nEntitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) must be considered in FSAD cases.  SMC (k) for loss of use (LOU) of a creative organ will be inferred and awarded whenever SC for FSAD is granted.\nNote:  If SC was previously established for FSAD but SMC was not awarded, place entitlement to SMC at issue and grant.  The effective date for the award of SMC will be the date SC for FSAD was established.\n2.  Other Gynecological Disorders\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information about evaluating other gynecological disorders, including\nSC for disorders of menstruation\nevaluating pelvic organ prolapse\nmalignant neoplasms of the gynecological system\ndisfigurement due to benign or malignant neoplasms\ncervical dysplasia\nhuman papillomavirus (HPV)\nchanges in the rating schedule for gynecological conditions and disorders of the breast, and\ninfertility.\nChange Date\nSeptember 30, 2025\nV.iii.8.A.2.a.  SC for Disorders of Menstruation\nA disease or injury resulting in ovarian dysfunction affecting the menstrual cycle, such as dysmenorrhea and secondary amenorrhea, can be service-connected (SC).  Evaluate using 38 CFR 4.116, DC 7615.\nNotes:\nSC cannot be established for primary amenorrhea or dysmenorrhea.  By definition, neither disorder would be incurred in or aggravated by service.\nSC can be established for secondary amenorrhea or dysmenorrhea when the evidence shows that the diagnosis is due to an ovarian disability or any other female reproductive organ disorder or other SC disability.\nV.iii.8.A.2.b.  Evaluating Pelvic Organ Prolapse\nApply the principles below to evaluate pelvic organ prolapse.\nDo not assign multiple evaluations under 38 CFR 4.116, DC 7621 for prolapse of multiple pelvic organs.\nWhen prolapse is incomplete or complete, assign a 10-percent evaluation.  In addition, evaluate residual disabilities or symptoms under the corresponding DC and combine, as usual, under 38 CFR 4.25.\nExample:  SC is warranted for pelvic organ prolapse.  Examination shows that, as a result of complete prolapse, the Veteran also experiences urinary incontinence requiring the wearing of absorbent materials that must be changed twice daily, impairment of sphincter control resulting in slight leakage, and localized dermatitis affecting less than five percent of body area that is treated with topical therapy.  The following evaluations will be established for the pelvic organ prolapse and residuals:\n38 CFR 4.116, DC 7621, 10 percent, pelvic organ prolapse\n38 CFR 4.115b, DC 7517, 20 percent, urinary incontinence due to pelvic organ prolapse\n38 CFR 4.114, DC 7332, 10 percent, impairment of sphincter control due to pelvic organ prolapse, and\n38 CFR 4.118, DC 7806, 0 percent, dermatitis due to pelvic organ prolapse.\nNote:  Prior to the changes to 38 CFR 4.116, effective May 13, 2018, these conditions were evaluated under 38 CFR 4.116, DC 7621 to 7623.\nReferences:  For more information on\neffective dates for decisions impacted by regulatory changes, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 4.A.6, and\nprotection of evaluations based on a change in diagnostic criteria, see M21-1, Part X, Subpart ii, 1.B.4.\nV.iii.8.A.2.c.  Malignant Neoplasms of the Gynecological System\nSeparate 100-percent evaluations will be assigned for both active gynecological cancer and active breast cancer.  Metastasis of a gynecological cancer or breast cancer to a different body system will also be evaluated separately.\nConsider corresponding entitlement to SMC.\nReferences:  For more information on\ntemporary total evaluations for cancers, see M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 8.D.3.e\nevaluating malignant neoplasms and associated impairments, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.D.5.a and b, and\nentitlement to SMC (k) for anatomical loss of a creative organ, see\n38 CFR 3.350(a), and\nM21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 4.A.4.d.\nV.iii.8.A.2.d.  Disfigurement Due to Benign or Malignant Neoplasms\nDo not evaluate disfigurement due to benign or malignant neoplasms of the gynecological system analogous to 38 CFR 4.118, DC 7800.  DC 7800 is for evaluation of disfigurement of the head, face, or neck only.\nV.iii.8.A.2.e.Cervical Dysplasia\nDo not routinely award SC for cervical dysplasia, also referred to as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).  Cervical dysplasia/CIN is not a disease or injury.  It is a cellular abnormality of the cervix revealed by Papanicolaou (Pap) smear testing that generally resolves without treatment or residuals.  In these cases, there is an abnormal laboratory finding but no disability, and SC is not warranted.\nSC may be warranted if cervical dysplasia/CIN\nrequires treatment that leaves residuals, or\nis linked to the subsequent development of cervical cancer.\nUse the table below to determine the appropriate actions to take when SC is claimed following an in-service confirmed finding of cervical dysplasia/CIN.\nIf medical evidence shows the subsequent development of …\nThen award SC for …\nAdditional Information to Consider\nchronic or severe dysplasia/CIN requiring treatment, and\nchronic residuals of the required treatment\nresiduals of cervical dysplasia/CIN.\nCommon procedures for treatment of chronic or severe dysplasia/CIN include\ncauterization\nlaser surgery\ncryosurgery, or\nloop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP).\ncervical cancer, and\na link between the in-service dysplasia/CIN and the cancer\ncervical cancer and/or residuals.\nIn-service cervical dysplasia that resolved without residuals is less likely to be related to later-developing cervical cancer.  However, these cases require a medical opinion to determine whether a relationship exists between the conditions.\nNote:  Cervical dysplasia is often associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.  There are over 60 types of HPV infection, and only certain types are associated with high-grade cervical dysplasia and cancer.\nV.iii.8.A.2.f.  HPV\nDo not routinely award SC for HPV infection.  Usually, HPV infections are asymptomatic and identified only as a finding on a Pap smear.  Most resolve spontaneously without residuals requiring only periodic pap smears for follow-up.  In these cases, there is an abnormal laboratory finding but no disability, and SC is not warranted.\nSC may be warranted if a disability develops as a result of an in-service HPV infection.  Two circumstances that may warrant SC are\ngenital warts that are shown in service or by nexus to be associated with the HPV infection, and\nHPV resulting in persistent infection that progresses to cervical dysplasia and subsequently to cervical cancer.\nImportant:  A medical nexus is required to establish an association between genital warts and in-service HPV infection or between cervical cancer and in-service HPV infection.\nNote:  There are multiple varieties of HPV infection which can cause common warts, plantar warts, and other findings.  HPV is not limited to sexual transmission.\nReferences:  For more information on considering claims for SC associated with sexually transmitted diseases, see\n38 CFR 3.301(c)(1), and\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 7.5.a.\nV.iii.8.A.2.g.  Changes in the Rating Schedule for Gynecological Conditions and Disorders of the Breast\nThe rating criteria for gynecological conditions and disorders of the breast have undergone historical changes.  Recent full-scale historical revisions were effective on the following dates:\nMay 13, 2018, and\nMay 22, 1995.\nNote:  These changes in the rating criteria\nare not considered liberalizing, and\nshould not be the basis for a reduction in disability rating unless medical evidence establishes that the disability has actually improved.\nV.iii.8.A.2.h.  Infertility\nInfertility, as defined in M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.C.4.a, can be a symptom or consequence of injury or disease.  If a Veteran claims SC for infertility, rate the underlying injury or disease under the appropriate DC.  Do not establish SC for infertility itself.\nSMC due to anatomical loss or loss of use of a creative organ is warranted when an SC condition results in infertility.\nReferences:  For more information on\nclaims involving contentions of infertility, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.C.4\nFSAD, see M21-1,

Disease\n2\nOther Hematologic and Lymphatic Conditions\n1.  Sickle Cell Disease\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information about hemic and lymphatic conditions, including\ndefinition of\nsickle cell disease, and\nsickle cell anemia\ninheritance of\nsickle cell trait, and\nsickle cell anemia\ncharacteristics of sickle cell anemia, and\nmechanism of inheritance of sickle hemoglobin.\nChange Date\nJune 14, 2019\nV.iii.9.1.a.Definition:  Sickle Cell Disease\nSickle cell disease is a generic term for all disorders characterized by the presence of sickle hemoglobin in the red blood cells and includes\nsickle cell anemia\nsickle cell trait, and\nother hemoglobinopathies such as\nsickle cell thalassemia, and\nsickle-hemoglobin C disease.\nNotes:\nThe phenomenon of sickling of red blood cells is a hereditary abnormality that of itself usually produces few ill effects.\nSickle cell trait alone is generally not a ratable disability, as provided in 38 CFR 4.117, diagnostic code (DC) 7714.\nV.iii.9.1.b.Definition: Sickle Cell Disease\nSickle cell anemia is a hereditary and familial disorder characterized clinically by symptoms of\nanemia\narthritis\nleg ulcers, and\nacute attacks of pain.\nNote:  The age of onset is generally early childhood.\nV.iii.9.1.c.Inheritance of Sickle Cell Trait\nInheritance of sickle cell trait may be from one or both parents.\nIf sickle hemoglobin is inherited from one parent and normal hemoglobin from the other, the combination is referred to as sickle cell trait.\nNote:  Except for unusual circumstances, this is a benign asymptomatic condition and is not associated with increased morbidity.\nV.iii.9.1.d.Inheritance of Sickle Cell Anemia\nThe inheritance of sickle hemoglobin from each parent results in sickle cell anemia.\nSickle cell anemia is usually accompanied by\nmoderate to severe anemia, and\nappropriate clinical signs and symptoms, such as\nenlargement of the heart\nabnormalities of the musculoskeletal system\nbone and joint pain, and/or\nfever.\nV.iii.9.1.e.Characteristics of Sickle Cell Anemia\nSickle cell anemia is a morbid state characterized by hemolytic anemia and the following manifestations\nthe presence of peculiar sickle-shaped, or oat-shaped, red blood cells\nsigns of excessive blood destruction and active blood formation, and\nrepeated vaso-occlusive episodes.\nV.iii.9.1.f.Mechanism of Inheritance of Sickle Hemoglobin\nThe presence of sickle hemoglobin, a variant of the normal hemoglobin in human red blood cells, is subject to the usual mechanisms of biologic inheritance.\n2.  Other Hematologic and Lymphatic Conditions\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information about hemic and lymphatic conditions, including\nassigning a permanent and total (P&T) evaluation for amyloid light chains (AL) amyloidosis (primary amyloidosis)\nreview examinations of non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) and other persistent cancers\npyramiding of NHL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)\nevaluating monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)\ndefinitions of bone marrow and stem cell transplant\nrating schedule update, and\nhistorical P&T evaluations.\nChange Date\nSeptember 15, 2025\nV.iii.9.2.a.Assigning a  P&T Evaluation for AL Amyloidosis\nAssign a permanent and total (P&T) evaluation for amyloid light chains (AL) amyloidosis (primary amyloidosis).  AL amyloidosis is considered incurable and progressive.\nNotes:\nEvaluate AL amyloidosis under 38 CFR 4.117, DC 7717.\nConsider ancillary benefits associated with the award of P&T disability evaluations.\nAL amyloidosis is a disability that is presumptively associated with herbicide exposure.\nReferences:  For more information on\nrating disabilities associated with herbicide exposure, see M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart i, 1.C, and\naddressing claims for P&T evaluation based on malignancy prognosis, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.D.4.i.\nV.iii.9.2.b.Review Examinations of NHL and Other Persistent Cancers\nWhen evaluating the need for a review examination at the two-year period prescribed in the rating schedule under 38 CFR 4.117, DC 7715, following discontinuance of the treatment phase for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) or any other persistent cancer with a high mortality rate, consider that the various therapeutic treatment modalities may continue at intervals greater than the review period indicated in the rating schedule.\nIf the disease has actively persisted for several years, thoroughly examine the medical record to determine whether the disease is\nactually in remission, or\nstill active and being regularly treated over extended periods of time.\nDo not schedule a review examination unless the record clearly shows a long-term and stable remission.\nImportant:  Consider assigning a P&T evaluation when a provision under 38 CFR 3.327(b)(2) applies or as otherwise warranted under the provisions of M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.D.4.\nReference:  For more information on when not to schedule a review examination, see M21-1, Part IV, Subpart ii, 1.A.1.d.\nV.iii.9.2.c.  Pyramiding of CLL and NHL\nDo not assign separate evaluations for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (38 CFR 4.117, DC 7703) and NHL (38 CFR 4.117, DC 7715).  They are cancers of the same body system and assignment of multiple evaluations would be pyramiding.\nIn cases where both cancers are diagnosed, assign the appropriate evaluation using a hyphenated DC.\nReferences:  For more information on\npyramiding, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.D.2.b, and\npresumptive service connection (SC) for CLL and NHL, see M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart i, 1.C.1.\nV.iii.9.2.d.  Evaluating MGUS\nMonoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is an asymptomatic, pre-malignant disorder characterized by monoclonal plasma cell proliferation in the bone marrow and absence of end organ damage.\nEvaluate MGUS under 38 CFR 4.117, DC 7712.\nNotes:\nMGUS is generally asymptomatic, but it can sometimes present with tingling or numbness in the hands or feet.\nRoutine blood tests can lead to MGUS detection.\nImportant:  MGUS does not have to be compensable to qualify for presumptive SC due to herbicide exposure.\nReference:  For more information on presumptive SC for MGUS based on herbicide exposure, see\nM21-1, Part VIII, Subpart i, 1.A, and\nM21-1, Part VIII, Subpart i, 1.C.\nV.iii.9.2.e.Definition:  Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplant\nA bone marrow transplant, also called a stem cell transplant, is a procedure used to infuse healthy cells, called stem cells, into the body to replace damaged or diseased bone marrow.  The process of infusing healthy cells into the body to replace diseased tissue may be referred to in a variety of manners based on the donor source and the type of tissue used.  The following procedures all satisfy the criteria for the 100-percent rating under 38 CFR 4.117:\nstem cell transplant\nbone marrow transplant\nbone marrow stem cell transplant\nperipheral blood transplant, and\nperipheral blood stem cell transplant.\nV.iii.9.2.f.  Rating Schedule Update\nThe criteria for rating disabilities of the hematologic and lymphatic systems in 38 CFR 4.117 were most recently updated effective\nDecember 9, 2018, and\nOctober 23, 1995.\nThe purpose of these updates was to\nincorporate medical advances\nupdate medical terminology\nadd disabilities not previously included, and\nrefine rating criteria.\nNote:  These updates were not liberalizing changes in the rating criteria.\nReference:  For more information on these and other historical changes to 38 CFR 4.117, see\n38 CFR 4, Appendix A\n38 CFR 4.117 (Historical), and\nthe Board of Veterans Appeal Research Tools website for historical 38 CFR 4.117.\nV.iii.9.2.g.  Historical P&T Evaluations\nHistorical policy guidance in existence prior to the December 9, 2018, rating schedule update directed the assignment of P&T evaluations for CLL and multiple myeloma.  P&T evaluations assigned under the prior version of the rating schedule with application of those policies are protected under 38 CFR 3.951(a).\nP&T evaluations were directed\nfrom November 6, 2003, to December 9, 2018, for CLL, with diagnosis being the sole requirement unless the condition was considered cured via treatment with a bone marrow transplant, and\nfrom January 28, 2003, to December 9, 2018, for multiple myeloma unless an exceptional situation was present in which inactive multiple myeloma was documented.\nImportant:\nIn all situations, the evidence of record must be analyzed to determine the treatment plan and prognosis for active malignancy associated with CLL or multiple myeloma.  As directed in M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.D.4, assign a P&T evaluation for active malignancy when warranted, whether the disability is evaluated under historical or current rating criteria.\nRevisions to 38 CFR 4.117, DCs 7703 and 7712 effective on December 9, 2018, provide criteria for scheduling review examinations for CLL and multiple myeloma unless there is clear evidence establishing a terminal prognosis.\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, Chapter 10 - Skin

Applying Alternative Rating Criteria in Evaluating Skin Conditions\nWhen 38 CFR 4.118 offers variable methods to evaluate a skin condition, assign a single evaluation using the criteria that results in the highest rating.\nExample:  Under 38 CFR 4.118 diagnostic code (DC) 7806, dermatitis is to be rated using the general rating formula for the skin.  Within the general rating formula, skin conditions are rated on either skin involvement/type of treatment or as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck or scars, depending upon the predominant disability.  For examination findings of dermatitis involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body (a 10-percent evaluation under 38 CFR 4.118 DC 7806) and scarring that is noncompensable under 38 CFR 4.118 DC 7800 through 38 CFR 4.118 DC 7805, a single evaluation of 10 percent is warranted under 38 CFR 4.118 DC 7806.  Assigning an evaluation for dermatitis based on percentage of involvement of the entire body and a separate evaluation based on the residual scarring amounts to pyramiding.\nReference:  For more information on avoidance of pyramiding, see\n38 CFR 4.14, and\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.D.2.b.\nV.iii.10.1.b.Separate Evaluations for Multiple Skin Disorders Using the General Rating Formula\nWhen evaluating separately diagnosed skin conditions and the predominant disability requires evaluation under the general rating formula for the skin, separate evaluations for each diagnosis are permissible when the evaluation is based on disability due solely to the individual diagnosis.\nHowever, when it is most advantageous and allows for maximized benefits, multiple skin disorders evaluated under the same criteria may be assigned a single disability evaluation as discussed in M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 10.1.e.\nV.iii.10.1.c.Separate Evaluations Using the General Rating Formula Based on Percentage of Affected Area\nA Veteran diagnosed with multiple skin conditions may receive separate evaluations using the general rating formula for the skin based on the percentage of exposed areas affected by each skin condition when\nseparate areas of skin are involved, and\nthe medical evidence clearly indicates that the percentages affected are due solely to each individual diagnosis.\nExample:  The medical evidence clearly indicates that skin condition X alone affects 6 percent of the exposed skin, while skin condition Y alone affects 12 percent of the exposed skin.  The area affected by each skin disability is entirely separate.  In this scenario, separate evaluations may be assigned.\nImportant:\nThe evidence must identify which residual disability is due to which individual skin condition.\nIt may be necessary to request clarification from an examiner to identify the percentage of exposed skin affected only by one skin condition versus the other skin condition.\nIf an examiner cannot provide separate percentages due solely to each skin condition, separate evaluations cannot be granted using those criteria alone.  If two or more skin conditions involve the same area of skin, assign the highest evaluation based on the combined area of involvement.\nThis guidance applies equally to evaluations based on the percentage of the entire body affected as well.\nReference:  For more information on assigning a single evaluation for multiple skin disabilities in order to maximize benefits, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 10.1.e.\nV.iii.10.1.d.Separate Evaluations Using the General Rating Formula Based on Medication Criteria\nIf the same medication(s) is/are used to treat each skin condition, separate evaluations may not be assigned unless alternative criteria are used to establish the disability evaluation for the separately evaluated skin condition(s) and separate areas of the skin are affected.\nExample:  The Veteran has dermatitis of the neck involving at least 5 percent but less than 20 percent of exposed body area.  The Veteran also has psoriasis on the knees involving less than 5 percent of total body area.  Both conditions were treated with oral corticosteroids for a period of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period.  Separate 10-percent disability evaluations may be assigned.  Assign a 10-percent evaluation for dermatitis based on exposed area affected and a separate 10-percent evaluation for psoriasis treated with oral steroids.\nImportant:  The decision maker should assign separate evaluations in a manner that provides the most advantageous rating for the Veteran.\nV.iii.10.1.e.  Single Evaluations Using the General Rating Formula for Multiple Skin Disorders\nA Veteran diagnosed with multiple skin conditions that are evaluated using the general rating formula for the skin based on the percentage of total body area or exposed areas affected may receive a single evaluation when\nevaluating the disabilities together allows for maximization of benefits, or\nthe symptoms of, and/or area affected by, the multiple disabilities cannot be separated, as is directed by 38 CFR 4.14.\nExample 1:  A Veteran has service-connected (SC) dermatitis that affects areas of the arms, covering 10 percent of the entire body area.  The Veteran also has SC tinea corporis affecting the groin and upper legs, covering 10 percent of the entire body area.  Different topical medications are used to treat each disability.  Evaluated individually, each skin disorder warrants a separate 10-percent evaluation under the general rating formula for the skin.  As the disabilities combine to affect a total 20 percent of the entire body and do not affect the same area of the body, a single 30-percent evaluation for dermatitis and tinea corporis may be assigned under 38 CFR 4.118, DC 7806-7813.  In this case, the single evaluation is assigned to maximize benefits since assignment of separate 10-percent evaluations would be a lesser benefit.\nExample 2:  A Veteran has SC dermatitis and eczema.  Both disabilities affect the hands, covering a total of 3 percent of exposed body area.  The examiner is unable to differentiate the percent of body area affected by each disorder.  The same topical treatment is used for both conditions.  A single 0-percent disability evaluation must be assigned since the evaluation of the same manifestation under different diagnoses must be avoided.\nNotes:\nWhen the Veteran has multiple SC skin disorders and maximization of benefits via assignment of a single evaluation appears possible but the examination results do not provide the specific measurements of affected body area, request clarification to determine the actual percentage of body area affected.\nWhen analysis shows that benefits maximization is possible with the assignment of a single disability evaluation, enter the disabilities as a single disorder in the Evaluation Builder.  For example, using the facts from Example 1 above, choose the predominant diagnosis and enter the single 20-percent finding for the percentage of body area affected.  This Evaluation Builder workaround must be utilized until updates are made for this functionality.\nV.iii.10.1.f.  Systemic Therapy Such as Corticosteroids or Other Immunosuppressive Drugs\nThe term systemic therapy that is contained in the general rating formula for the skin and in certain additional DCs under 38 CFR 4.118 refers to treatment that is administered through any route (orally, injection, suppository, intranasally) other than the skin.  Medications that are applied topically (directly to the skin), including topical corticosteroids or immunosuppressives, are not considered systemic for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) purposes.\nNotes:\nWhen there is a question as to whether drug treatment is systemic therapy for rating purposes, request clarification from a VA or other licensed medical professional.\nThe changes to 38 CFR 4.118 effective August 13, 2018, preclude any consideration of topical therapy as systemic therapy, irrespective of the extent of application to the body.\nFor claims filed prior to August 13, 2018, where the skin condition is evaluated under the historical 38 CFR 4.118, medications that are applied topically (directly to the skin), including topical corticosteroids or immunosuppressives, are generally not considered systemic for VA purposes.  Under the historical rating criteria, a topical corticosteroid may only be considered systemic therapy where it is administered on such a large scale over the body that it affects the body as a whole.\nIf the evidence suggests that a skin disability is treated so extensively with a topical corticosteroid that it may be consistent with systemic therapy, refer the case to an appropriate dermatology specialist for an opinion addressing whether the topical corticosteroid is used so extensively on the body that it may be considered systemic therapy.\nIf the matter cannot be resolved after obtaining the medical opinion, refer the case to Compensation Service for an advisory opinion.\nExample:  A Veteran is SC for dermatitis herpetiformis.  Medical evidence shows she was treated with oral Dapsone for 7 weeks during the past 12-month period.  An evaluation of 30 percent is warranted for treatment with systemic therapy for a total duration of six weeks or more, but not constantly, during the past 12-month period.\nReferences:  For more information on\nthe meaning of “such as” in the rating schedule, see Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet.App. 436 (2002), and\ndetermining whether topical corticosteroids can be considered systemic under historical rating criteria, see\nJohnson v. Shulkin, 862 F.3d 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2017), and\nBurton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet.App. 286 (2018), and\nrequesting advisory opinions, see M21-1, Part X, Subpart v, 1.A.2.\nV.iii.10.1.g.  Exposed Body Area\nWhen evaluating disabilities under 38 CFR 4.118, exposed areas as referenced in evaluation criteria refer to the face, neck, and hands.\nV.iii.10.1.h.  Application of the Bilateral Factor to Evaluations for Skin Conditions to Include Scarring\nThe bilateral factor under 38 CFR 4.26 only applies to skin conditions rated based on the skin evaluation criteria under 38 CFR 4.118, DCs 7801 or 7802 as the evaluation criteria and notes provided by these DCs specifically address entitlement to separate evaluations for multiple extremity involvement.  The bilateral factor may also be for application for conditions rated under a DC with evaluation criteria not considering skin involvement (such as when the predominant disability is that pertaining to musculoskeletal impairment).  Do not apply the bilateral factor to DCs for skin conditions to include scars that are\nbased on whole-body involvement\nbased on number of debilitating episodes, or\nspecific to the head, face, and/or neck.\nExamples:\nThe bilateral factor is not for application to 38 CFR 4.118, DC 7804 as painful or unstable scars are not evaluated separately under this DC.\nFor ratings based on malignant skin neoplasms under 38 CFR 4.118, DC 7818, the bilateral factor is not for application when assigning a 100-percent evaluation for active malignancy/treatment for six months following cessation.  However, when evaluating based on residuals following the six-month period, the bilateral factor may or may not apply depending on whether the residual is being evaluated based on a qualifying DC.\nV.iii.10.1.i.  Revisions of the Skin Rating Schedule\nRegulatory revisions to the rating schedule are generally not liberalizing, including those revisions to 38 CFR 4.118 effective October 23, 2008, and August 13, 2018.  38 CFR 3.114(a) does not apply because the regulatory revision did not characterize the change as a liberalizing change of law or VA issue.\nReference:  For more information on assigning effective dates based on regulatory updates to the rating schedule, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 4.A.6.\n2.  Rating Scars or Other Disfigurement of the Head, Face, or Neck\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information on rating scars or other disfigurement of the head, face, or neck, including\nconsidering color photographs in evaluating scars or other disfigurement\nevaluating\nmultiple scars, and\ntissue loss of the auricle, anatomical loss of the eye, and other disabling effects, and\nwhether scars or disfigurement of the head, face, or neck are part of the claim.\nChange Date\nAugust 13, 2018\nV.iii.10.2.a.  Considering Color Photographs in Evaluating Scars or Other Disfigurement\nWhen an examination report indicates that photographs have been taken of a scar or skin condition, consider the photographs when evaluating the condition.\nReference:  For more information on procedures for handling photographs associated with skin and scars examinations, see M21-1, Part IV, Subpart i, 3.B.1.k.\nV.iii.10.2.b.  Evaluating Multiple Scars\nScars of the head, face, or neck are evaluated based on characteristics of disfigurement.  For all characteristics of disfigurement included in 38 CFR 4.118, DC 7800 that are evaluated based on size of area affected, the area affected by multiple scars may be added together to meet the total area criteria for the characteristic of disfigurement.  The characteristics of disfigurement criteria that can be met by adding the area affected by multiple scars include\nlength\nhypo- or hyper-pigmentation\nabnormal skin texture\nabsence of underlying soft tissue, and\ninduration or inflexibility.\nException:  Multiple scars may not be added together to meet the width of scarring requirement.\nExamples:\nTwo scars, one measuring two inches in length and the other measuring three inches in length, may be combined to meet the requirement of a scar five inches or more in length to qualify as a characteristic of disfigurement.\nIn contrast, two scars, one measuring 0.13 inches in width and the other measuring 0.12 inches in width, may not be combined to meet the requirement of a scar at least one-quarter inch wide at the widest part.\nReferences:  For more information on evaluating\nmultiple painful or unstable scars, see 38 CFR 4.118, DC 7804, and\nmultiple burn or other scars not of the head, face, or neck, see\n38 CFR 4.118, DC 7801, Notes 1 and 2, and\n38 CFR 4.118, DC 7802, Notes 1 and 2.\nV.iii.10.2.c.  Evaluating Tissue Loss of the Auricle, Anatomical Loss of the Eye, and Other Disabling Effects\nEvaluate tissue loss of the auricle under 38 CFR 4.87, DC 6207 and anatomical loss of the eye under 38 CFR 4.79, DC 6061 or 6063, as appropriate.\nWhen the evidence of record shows disabling effects other than disfigurement, such as pain, instability, or muscle/nerve injury, separately evaluate under the appropriate DC based on the functional impairment shown by the record.\nReference:  For more information on evaluating scars and what qualifies as a characteristic of disfigurement, see 38 CFR 4.118.\nV.iii.10.2.d.Whether Scars or Disfigurement of the Head, Face, or Neck Are Part of the Claim\nIf a scar or other disfigurement of the head, face, or neck is noted on VA examination or in other evidence of record but has not been expressly claimed, whether to put it at issue and decide it as part of the claim depends on whether the scar is considered within scope of the pending claim.\nReferences:  For more information on\nwithin-scope determinations, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.A.1.c, and\nsoliciting a claim for unclaimed chronic disabilities shown by the evidence, see M21-1, Part II, Subpart iii, 2.G.2.\n3.  Rating Painful or Unstable Scars\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information on rating painful or unstable scars, including\nassigning a separate disability evaluation for functional impairment due to a painful scar\nobjective evidence of a painful scar\ndefinition of an unstable scar\nevaluating unstable and painful scars, and\nwhether painful or unstable scars are part of the claim.\nChange Date\nAugust 13, 2018\nV.iii.10.3.a.  Assigning a Separate Disability Evaluation for Functional Impairment Due to a Painful Scar\nA separate disability evaluation for a painful scar under 38 CFR 4.118, DC 7804may be assigned when the evidence demonstrates functional impairment that\nis distinct and separate from the functional impairment addressed by another DC, and\nis not duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology addressed under another DC.\nExample:  A separate 10-percent evaluation for disfigurement under 38 CFR 4.118, DC 7800 may be assigned in addition to a 10-percent evaluation for painful scars under 38 CFR 4.118, DC 7804 and a 10-percent evaluation for facial injury interfering with mastication under 38 CFR 4.73, DC 5325 as each evaluation is based on distinct and separate functional impairment and, therefore, provisions related to pyramiding are not violated.\nNote:  An evaluation under 38 CFR 4.118, DC 7800 is entirely cosmetic in nature.\nReferences:  For more information on\nassigning a separate disability evaluation for functional impairment due to a painful scar, see Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet.App. 259 (1994)\nevaluating scars in the presence of muscle injuries, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 1.E.2.h, and\npyramiding, see\n38 CFR 4.14, and\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.D.2.b.\nV.iii.10.3.b.  Objective Evidence of a Painful Scar\nUnder 38 CFR 4.118, DC 7804, an evaluation of 10 percent is assigned for one or two scars that are unstable or painful.\nDo not establish a compensable evaluation for a painful scar unless there is some objective indication supporting subjective reports of pain or tenderness.\nThe physical examination section (for the trunk/extremities or the head/face/neck, as applicable) of the Scars/Disfigurement Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) asks the examiner if scars are tender to palpation and, if yes, to check the box.  If the examiner checks that a scar is tender to palpation, consider pain to be objectively demonstrated.\nExample:  On VA examination, the Veteran gave a history of a painful scar of the trunk.  On the DBQ, in the physical examination of the trunk and extremities, the examiner checked that the trunk scar was tender to palpation.  Accept that the scar is objectively painful.\nExample:  On VA examination, the Veteran gave a history of a painful scar of the left arm.  On the DBQ, in the physical examination of the trunk and extremities, the examiner did not check that the scar was tender to palpation.  Do not accept that the scar is objectively painful.\nV.iii.10.3.c.  Definition:  Unstable Scar\nAn unstable scar is a scar in which, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.\nReference:  For more information on unstable scars, see 38 CFR 4.118, DC 7804.\nV.iii.10.3.d.  Evaluating Unstable and Painful Scars\nWhen a scar is both unstable and painful, add 10 percent to the evaluation that would otherwise be assigned based on the total number of unstable or painful scars under 38 CFR 4.118, DC 7804.\nExample:  If a VA examination notes one right knee arthroscopy scar that is described as unstable and painful, the proper evaluation based on the painful and unstable scar is 20 percent.  Under 38 CFR 4.118, DC 7804, one painful scar is entitled to an evaluation of 10 percent.  Since the painful scar is also noted to be unstable, an additional 10 percent is added to that evaluation to arrive at an overall evaluation of 20 percent.\nV.iii.10.3.e.Whether Painful or Unstable Scars Are Part of the Claim\nIf a painful or unstable scar is noted on VA examination or in other evidence of record but has not been expressly claimed, whether to put it at issue and decide it as part of the claim depends on whether the scar is considered within scope of the pending claim.\nReferences:  For more information on\nwithin-scope determinations, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.A.1.c, and\nsoliciting a claim for unclaimed chronic disabilities shown by the evidence, see M21-1, Part II, Subpart iii, 2.G.2.\n4.  Rating Specific Skin Conditions\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information on rating specific skin conditions, including\nSC for male pattern baldness or androgenetic alopecia\nassigning multiple evaluations due to hair loss, and\nevaluating mycosis fungoides.\nChange Date\nNovember 19, 2018\nV.iii.10.4.a. SC for Male Pattern Baldness or Androgenetic Alopecia\nDo not grant SC for\nmale pattern baldness, or\nandrogenetic alopecia.\nNote:  VA classifies these conditions as congenital or developmental abnormalities.\nImportant:  While SC is not warranted for alopecia of androgenetic origin, VA recognizes hair loss due to scarring alopecia and alopecia areata under 38 CFR 4.118, DCs 7830 and 7831, as disabilities for which SC is warranted if first manifested in service.\nReference:  For more information on congenital or developmental abnormalities, see\n38 CFR 4.9, and\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 2.E.\nV.iii.10.4.b.Assigning Multiple Evaluations Due to Hair Loss\nAssign separate evaluations for\ncomplete loss of the eyebrows and eyelashes due to injury, burns, or local disease under 38 CFR 4.79, DC 6023\ncomplete loss of the eyelashes due to injury, burns, or local disease under 38 CFR 4.79, DC 6024, and\nloss of all body hair due to alopecia areata or an analogous condition under 38 CFR 4.118, DC 7831.\nV.iii.10.4.c.  Evaluating Mycosis Fungoides\nMycosis fungoides is a cutaneous manifestation of T-cell lymphoma that typically presents as some form of skin lesion and rarely progresses beyond the skin.\nFor rating purposes, it is not considered a systemic malignancy.  As such, with the revised skin rating schedule, mycosis fungoides should be evaluated under 38 CFR 4.118, DC 7822.\nIf the condition progresses to a lymphoma with appropriate diagnosis, such as Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (active disease/active treatment phase), it would warrant an evaluation under 38 CFR 4.117, DC 7715.\nNote:  Prior to the rating schedule change of August 13, 2018, mycosis fungoides was evaluated as either\na skin malignancy if manifestations were cutaneous lesions only and treatment was confined to only\nlocalized topical therapy, or\nsurgical excision (wide local excision or less extensive excision), or\nnon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma if manifestations were indicative of systemic disease with treatment consistent with systemic malignancy.\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, Chapter 11 - Endocrine Conditions\nArticle ID: 554400000180518\nUpdated May 28, 2025\n<-- Previous Section   Next Section -->\nOverview\nIn This Chapter\nThis chapter contains the following topics:\nTopic\nTopic Name\n1\nDiabetes Mellitus\n2\nComplications of Diabetes Mellitus\n3\nThyroid Conditions\n4\nExamples of Rating Decisions Involving the Complications of Diabetes Mellitus\n1.  Diabetes Mellitus\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information about diabetes mellitus, including\ndefinition of diabetes mellitus\nsymptoms of diabetes mellitus\nevaluating diabetes mellitus\nsuccessive criteria requirement for the next higher disability evaluation\ninformation on regulation of activities\nscope of diabetes mellitus claims\nrequesting examinations for diabetes mellitus or diabetic complications\nfailure to report in claims for increase in diabetes mellitus, and\neffective dates for\nservice connection (SC) of diabetes mellitus, and\nclaims for increase of diabetes mellitus.\nChange Date\nJune 6, 2024\nV.iii.11.1.a.  Definition: Diabetes Mellitus\nDiabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder in which the body is unable to use glucose (a type of sugar obtained from food) effectively.  Hyperglycemia, an abnormally high level of blood sugar, results.\nDiabetes mellitus is not seriously disabling if, on a diet sufficient to maintain the weight and strength of the claimant, the\nblood glucose can be kept within normal limits, and\nurine is absent glucose.\nAs diabetes mellitus progresses\nit becomes more difficult to control, even with insulin\ncomplications develop which increase the degree of disability, and\nincreasing limitation of activity due to unstable blood sugar levels limits employability.\nV.iii.11.1.b.  Symptoms of Diabetes Mellitus\nThe cardinal symptoms of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus are\npolyuria (excessive urination)\npolydipsia (excessive thirst)\npolyphagia (excessive hunger)\nweakness, and\nloss of weight.\nThe presence of sugar in the urine is characteristic of, but not essential to, a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.\nNotes:\nA diagnosis of diabetes mellitus cannot be made from glycosuria alone, as this may result from\na low renal threshold for sugar, or\nexcessive ingestion of sugar.\nPersistent hyperglycemia, a blood sugar of 170 milligrams (mg) per 100 cubic centimeters (ccs) blood after 12-hour fast, and glycosuria may be related to\nhyperthyroidism\ndyspituitarism\npregnancy\napoplexy\ncerebral trauma, or\nsevere infections.\nV.iii.11.1.c.  Evaluating Diabetes Mellitus\nEvaluations of diabetes mellitus are assigned under 38 CFR 4.119, diagnostic code (DC) 7913.  The diagnostic criteria take into account\nthe means necessary to control diabetes, specifically\nrestricted diet\noral hypoglycemic agent\none or more daily injection of insulin, and\nregulation of activities\nfrequency of specific types of care for episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions\nhospitalizations, or\nvisits to a diabetic care provider\nprogressive loss of weight and strength, and\ndiabetic complications.\nNote:  To treat diabetes mellitus, medical providers may prescribe non-insulin injectable medications, such as Ozempic, Victoza, Trulicity, or other generic versions.  These medications are distinctly different from injectable insulin.  Like oral hypoglycemic agents, non-insulin injectable medications help lower blood glucose levels.  For rating purposes, evaluate a prescription for a non-insulin injectable medication in the same manner as a prescription for an oral hypoglycemic agent.  Do not consider a non-insulin injectable medication as equivalent to treatment with insulin.\nReferences:  For more information on\nevaluating complications of diabetes mellitus, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 11.2.b, and\nscope of diabetes mellitus claims, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 11.1.f.\nV.iii.11.1.d.Successive Criteria Requirement for the Next Higher Disability Evaluation\nWhen determining the appropriate disability evaluation to assign for diabetes mellitus, note that the criteria are successive.  This means the Veteran can only be rated at the next higher disability evaluation when all criteria at the lower disability evaluation are met plus element(s) specific to the higher evaluation are satisfied.\nReferences:  For more information on\ndiabetes mellitus, see\n38 CFR 4.119, DC 7913, and\nCamacho v. Nicholson, 21 Vet.App. 360 (2007), and\nrelationships within evaluation criteria, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.D.2.a.\nV.iii.11.1.e.Information on Regulation of Activities\nThe term regulation of activities is defined parenthetically in 38 CFR 4.119, DC 7913 to mean the requirement of “avoidance of strenuous occupational and recreational activities.”  In turn, this must be understood as meaning that the avoidance is required to help control blood sugar.\nVoluntary avoidance of strenuous activity by the Veteran, undertaken with the intention of avoiding hypoglycemic episodes, does not meet the regulatory criteria.  Evidence must document that the avoidance of strenuous activities is required/prescribed as part of medical management of the individual’s diabetes.\nPrescribed or voluntary exercise also does not satisfy the regulation-of-activities criterion.\nNotes:\nWhich specific activities are medically contraindicated as strenuous (what medical restrictions have been prescribed) is a factual medical question.\nThe Diabetes Mellitus Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) requires that the examiner address whether avoidance of strenuous occupational and recreational activities to avoid hypoglycemic episodes is required as part of medical management of diabetes mellitus, and if so, to provide examples.\nThe conclusion that “regulation of activities” is demonstrated is an adjudicative determination.\nIt is the Department of Veteran’s Affairs (VA’s) policy to concede that an individual’s diabetes mellitus requires insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities when the diabetes has caused episodes of ketoacidosis that have resulted in hospitalization.\nV.iii.11.1.f.   Scope of Diabetes Mellitus Claims\nAs discussed in M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.A, determining what issues are within scope of a claim is a case-by-case determination based on a sympathetic reading of the evidence.\nWhen reviewing claims for diabetes mellitus, including diabetic complications, consider whether the evidence establishes entitlement to\nan increased evaluation for the\ndiabetes mellitus, and/or\nservice-connected (SC) complication(s), and/or\nservice connection (SC) for expressly claimed or newly discovered, unclaimed complications.\nNotes:\nAs complications of diabetes mellitus are part of the evaluation criteria for the disease, entitlement to any additional benefits based on complications would be considered within scope of the claim.\nFollow the guidance in M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.A.2.c for handling complications of an expressly claimed issue, including when to obtain adequate medical evidence, such as an examination.\nReferences:  For more information on\nclaim requirements and scope of claim, see 38 CFR 3.155\nclarifying issues and claims, see M21-1, Part III, Subpart i, 2.D.1.c, and\naddressing unclaimed hypertension as a complication of diabetes mellitus, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 11.2.f.\nV.iii.11.1.g.Requesting Examinations for Diabetes Mellitus or Diabetic Complications\nRefer to the table below for general guidance on determining which examinations to request in claims for diabetes mellitus or diabetic complications.\nIf the claim wording is interpreted as requesting compensation for ...\nThen request ...\ndiabetes mellitus (initial SC or an increased evaluation) with or without complications specified\nthe Diabetes Mellitus Disability Benefits Questionnaire, when necessary to decide the claim.\nImportant:\nIf the Veteran explicitly claims a diabetic complication (new or increased evaluation), or is already SC for a complication(s), include a comment in the examination request to alert the examiner.\nThe Diabetes Mellitus Disability Benefits Questionnaire must address all diabetic complications present, to include completion of additional DBQs as appropriate.\nIf the examiner fails to address all diabetic complications and complete all necessary DBQs, the examination must be returned as insufficient.\na specified diabetic complication(s) (new or an increased evaluation)\nthe specific DBQ(s) associated with the claimed complication(s), when necessary to decide the claim.\nNote:  Do not request the Diabetes Mellitus Disability Benefits Questionnaire.\nImportant:  Worsening of a diabetic complication could indicate a broader worsening of the diabetes generally.  When worsening in the diabetic process is shown, follow procedures for deciding all issues within scope of the claim as outlined in\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 11.1.f, and\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.A.2.c.\nReferences:  For more information on\nwhen an examination is necessary to decide a claim, see M21-1, Part IV, Subpart i, 1.A and B, and\ndeveloping for a relationship between diabetes mellitus and hypertension, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 11.2.g.\nV.iii.11.1.h.Failure to Report in Claims for Increase in Diabetes Mellitus\nSee the table below for guidance on the correct rating action to take when a claimant fails to report for a necessary VA examination in connection with a claim for increase for diabetes mellitus.\nIf the claim ...\nThen ...\nis limited to an increase in one or more separately evaluated diabetic complications\ndeny an increase for the claimed complication(s) based on failure to report for the examination without good cause.\nException:  If

reevaluation or increase for diabetes mellitus, whether or not it mentions complications\ndeny\nan increase in the evaluation for the diabetic process, and\nany expressly claimed diabetic

complications of diabetes mellitus, including\ncommon complications of diabetes mellitus\nevaluating complications of diabetes mellitus\neffective date for diabetic complications\ncardiovascular complications of diabetes mellitus\nwhen evidence supports that hypertension is or is not a complication of diabetes mellitus\naddressing unclaimed hypertension as a complication of diabetes mellitus\ndevelopment on the relationship between diabetes mellitus and hypertension\nneurological complications of diabetes mellitus\nophthalmological complications of diabetes mellitus\ngenitourinary complications of diabetes mellitus\nmusculoskeletal complications of diabetes mellitus\nimmune and other miscellaneous complications of diabetes mellitus, and\nskin complications of diabetes mellitus.\nChange Date\nNovember 29, 2016\nV.iii.11.2.a.Common Complications of Diabetes Mellitus\nAs noted in M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 11.1.a, complications are disabilities of various body systems, including but not limited to the following, caused by progression of diabetes:\ncardiovascular\nneurological\nophthalmological\ngenitourinary\ngynecological\nmusculoskeletal\nimmune, and\nskin.\nNotes:  Once diabetic complications begin, multiple complications are usually considered or involved.\nReference:  For more information on scope of claim and examination requirements in claims for diabetes mellitus, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 11.1.f and g.\nV.iii.11.2.b.Evaluating Complications of Diabetes Mellitus\nPer 38 CFR 4.119, DC 7913, evaluate compensable complications of diabetes mellitus separately unless they are a part of the criteria used to support a 100-percent evaluation.\nNoncompensable complications are considered part of the diabetic process under 38 CFR 4.119, DC 7913.\nBefore conceding that a particular disability is a complication of diabetes, ensure that there is medical evidence of record supporting that determination.  In some cases, a particular disability of a body part of system could be a diabetic complication or it could be due to another cause.  For example, neurological symptoms in the lower extremities could represent the common complication diabetic peripheral neuropathy.  However, they could also be due to another etiology such as a spinal injury, peripheral vascular disease or multiple sclerosis.\nReferences:  For more information on\nexamples of rating decisions involving the complications of diabetes mellitus, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 11.4, and\navoidance of pyramiding, see\n38 CFR 4.14, and\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.D.2.b.\nV.iii.11.2.c.Effective Date for Diabetic Complications\nBecause diabetes mellitus is an endocrine disorder with potential multi-system effects, onset of diabetic complications represents medical progression or worsening of diabetes, and diabetic complications are contemplated in the evaluation criteria under 38 CFR 4.119, DC 7913, a claim asserting new complications of SC diabetes is a claim for increase rather than a claim for secondary SC.\nTherefore, when assigning effective dates for new diabetic complications, consider effective date provisions applicable to increases, specifically\n38 CFR 3.400(o), and\n38 CFR 3.157 for periods prior to March 24, 2015.\nReferences:  For more information on\neffective dates for\nSC diabetes mellitus, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 11.1.i, and\nincreased evaluations for diabetes mellitus, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 11.1.j, and\ndetermining the scope of, and examination requirements for, claims for diabetes, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 11.1.f and g.\nV.iii.11.2.d.Cardiovascular Complications of Diabetes Mellitus\nDiabetic cardiovascular complications include, but are not limited to\nhypertension\natherosclerosis (used interchangeably with arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease))\nperipheral arterial disease\nperipheral vascular disease\ncardiomyopathy\ncongestive heart failure, and\nstroke (macrovascular complication).\nReferences:  For more information on\ncardiovascular complications, see\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 5, and\n38 CFR 4.104, and\nmacrovascular complications to include stroke, see 38 CFR 4.124(a).\nV.iii.11.2.e. When Evidence Supports That Hypertension Is or Is Not a Complication of Diabetes Mellitus\nAnalyze the evidentiary record to determine if it contains evidence specifically addressing whether hypertension is or is not a complication of diabetes mellitus.\nIn the absence of record evidence specifically addressing the question of whether hypertension is related to diabetes mellitus\nconsider hypertension to be a complication of diabetes mellitus when onset of hypertension occurred after a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy (The onset of hypertension after diabetes mellitus without diabetic nephropathy is not sufficient.), and\ndo not consider hypertension to be a complication of diabetes mellitus when\nonset of hypertension was before diabetes mellitus (with or without diabetic nephropathy), and\nthere has been no change in the treatment of hypertension or increase in blood pressure readings.\nImportant:\nEvaluate the competency, credibility, and probative value of evidence in line with the principles in M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 1.A.\nThe analysis above should be used in determining whether or not to address unclaimed hypertension as a complication of diabetes mellitus and making a decision on the merits of the raised claim as detailed in M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 11.2.f.\nV.iii.11.2.f.  Addressing Unclaimed Hypertension as a Complication of Diabetes Mellitus\nRaise and decide whether hypertension is a complication of diabetes mellitus in the absence of an explicit claim only when the evidence supports a grant.  Do not raise and deny the matter of entitlement to hypertension as a complication of diabetes mellitus when it is not explicitly claimed.\nDo not raise the issue simply because the record shows hypertension and diabetes mellitus (even if there is diabetic nephropathy).  This alone is not sufficient to support that hypertension is a complication of diabetes mellitus.\nImportant:  The policy stated in this block does not prohibit a determination of whether hypertension is a complication of diabetes mellitus when initial evaluation or reevaluation of diabetes mellitus is within the scope of the claim.  The scope and degree of severity of complications is part of any claim involving evaluation of diabetes mellitus.  However, the issue, unless explicitly claimed, should only be raised if SC may be awarded for hypertension as a complication of diabetes mellitus.\nV.iii.11.2.g.Development on the Relationship Between Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension\nThere are fact patterns where the evidence supports or does not support that hypertension is a complication of diabetes mellitus.\nIn the context of an explicit claim that hypertension is a complication of diabetes mellitus or in the context of evaluation of the extent of diabetes mellitus (to include whether there are complications of diabetes mellitus), a medical diagnosis or opinion may be necessary to determine whether hypertension is a complication of diabetes mellitus.\nWhen there is an explicit claim as discussed above, obtain a medical diagnosis or opinion to determine if hypertension is a complication of diabetes mellitus in the following fact patterns:\nmedical evidence shows\nhypertension was diagnosed before diabetes mellitus or before diabetic nephropathy, but\nthere has been a subsequent change in the treatment of hypertension and/or an increase in blood pressure readings thereafter (particularly if this occurred after the onset of diabetic nephropathy), or\nmedical evidence shows no clear indication as to\nwhen hypertension was diagnosed, or\nwhether hypertension has worsened since the onset of diabetic nephropathy.\nImportant:  When there is not an explicit claim that hypertension is a complication of diabetes mellitus and when hypertension in an initial evaluation or reevaluation of diabetes mellitus is not within the scope of the claim, do not develop for a diagnosis or opinion on whether hypertension is a complication of diabetes mellitus.\nV.iii.11.2.h.Neurological Complications of Diabetes Mellitus\nDiabetic neurological complications affecting the nervous system stem from a disturbance of metabolism or ischemia (inadequate blood supply) to the nerves.  One of the most common disabilities is peripheral neuropathy.  Complications affecting the peripheral nerves can extend from the brain and spinal cord to the muscles, skin, and internal organs.  The table below contains a description of symptoms that can be caused by a peripheral nerve disability.\nSymptoms of Peripheral Neuropathy\nDescription\nparesthesias\nnumbness, and\ntingling\nhyperesthesias\nincreased sensitivity to touch\nhypesthesia (or hypoesthesia)\ndecreased sensitivity to touch\nloss of sensation\nlack of feeling\npain\nburning\nlancinating, or\nlightning sensations\ndysesthesia\nunusual and unpleasant sensation after normal stimulation\nmuscle weakness\nlack of strength\nNote:  Findings are typically in a stocking-glove distribution.\nReference:  For more information on evaluating peripheral nerve disorders, see\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 12.A.\nV.iii.11.2.i.Ophthalmological Complications of Diabetes Mellitus\nDiabetic ophthalmological complications are largely due to blood vessel damage caused by high blood sugars such as leakage (hemorrhage) and/or blood vessel blockage.  The table below contains a description of diabetic eye complications.\nDiabetic Eye Complications\nDescription\ndiabetic retinopathy\nimpairment or loss of vision due to damage affecting blood vessels of the retina\ncataract\nclouding or opaqueness of the lens of the eye\nglaucoma\nincreased fluid pressure in the eye, and\ncauses loss of visual fields due to optic nerve damage\nReference:  For more information on ophthalmological complications, see\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 2.A, and\n38 CFR 4.79.\nV.iii.11.2.j.Genitourinary Complications of Diabetes Mellitus\nDiabetic nephropathy is a common diabetic genitourinary complication of diabetes mellitus and may be rated based on criteria including\nrenal dysfunction, if renal function is affected\nvoiding dysfunction, if there is incontinence from autonomic nephropathy\nurinary tract infection, if there is chronic pyelonephritis, as appropriate\nkidney transplant\nhemodialysis, or\nnephrectomy.\nNote:  Erectile dysfunction (impotence/retrograde ejaculation) is another common complication of diabetes mellitus.\nReference:  For more information on genitourinary complications and potential entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC), see\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 7\nM21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 4.A\n38 CFR 4.115a, and\n38 CFR 4.115b.\nV.iii.11.2.k.Musculoskeletal Complications of Diabetes Mellitus\nDiabetic musculoskeletal complications affect the feet, ankles, bones, extremities, and overall gait.  The table below contains a description of diabetic musculoskeletal complications.\nDiabetic Musculoskeletal Complications\nDescription\nfoot complications\naffects muscles, joints, and bones\nfoot neuropathic ulcers\nresults from abnormal pressure and lack of sensitivity to pain\nleads to callus formation, osteomyelitis, and/or gangrene\nabnormalities of gait\nsensory ataxia to include loss of balance and poor muscle coordination due to loss of position sense\nCharcot joints (neuropathic osteoarthropathy)\ndegenerative changes\ninstability, and\npossible fragmentation of bones, particularly bones of the feet and ankles\namputations\nextremities, or\nparts of extremities\nReference:  For more information on musculoskeletal disabilities, see\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 1\n38 CFR 4.71a, and\n38 CFR 4.73.\nV.iii.11.2.l.Immune and Other Miscellaneous Complications of Diabetes Mellitus\nHyperglycemia causes the white blood cells of the immune system to function poorly.  In addition, all of the body's fluids have higher levels of sugar and nutrients, which make them more inviting for bacteria to grow and multiply.  This causes infections to be more serious and difficult to cure.  The table below contains a description of diabetic immune and other miscellaneous complications.\nDiabetic Immune and Other Miscellaneous Complications\nDescription\nReferences\nmalignant external otitis\na bacterial infection in older patients that causes\nsevere ear pain\nnecrosis of the external auditory canal, and\nfever, and may also cause\nparalysis of the facial nerve\nparalysis of other cranial nerves, and osteomyelitis of the base of the skull\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 2.B, and\n38 CFR 4.87.\nnasopharyngeal mucormycosis\na rare and serious fungal infection, which usually develops during or following an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis\nsudden onset with periorbital edema, pain, bloody nasal discharge,

appearing on the hands or feet that heal in two to five weeks, sometimes with scarring and atrophy\natrophy of fatty tissue or skin thickening\nresulting from insulin injections\nReference:  For more information on skin disabilities, see\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 10, and\n38 CFR 4.118.\n3.  Thyroid Conditions\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information about thyroid conditions, including\ndefinitions of hyper- and hypothyroidism\nevaluating thyroid disabilities after the initial diagnosis\nrating thyroid enlargement, nontoxic\ndefinition of myxedema, and\nchanges in the endocrine rating schedule.\nChange Date\nDecember 11, 2017\nV.iii.11.3.a.  Definitions:  Hyper- and Hypothyroidism\nHyperthyroidism (over-active thyroid) is a disorder where the thyroid gland synthesizes or creates excessive amounts of thyroid hormone.\nNote:  This condition may also be diagnosed as Graves’ disease.\nHypothyroidism (under-active thyroid) is a disorder where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone.\nV.iii.11.3.b.  Evaluating Thyroid Disabilities After the Initial Diagnosis\nWhen a thyroid DC calls for an initial evaluation, the initial evaluation, by its very nature, is not considered static.  Most symptoms of these conditions are alleviated within the initial period of treatment.\nWhen the rating schedule requires the assignment of an evaluation for a specified period after the initial diagnosis, establish the initial evaluation for any applicable period for which the Veteran is eligible; and thereafter, evaluate based on residuals of the disease in the affected body system(s) as directed by the relevant DC.\nNotes:\nIn cases where the claim is being decided during the initial evaluation period, establish controls for a review exam at the end of that period to determine the appropriate evaluation.\nFor any complications shown on the review examination, follow the procedures in M21-1, Part IV, Subpart ii, 2.A.1.b for awarding benefits for residuals of the primary SC disability.\nIf treatment for one form of thyroid dysfunction causes a new diagnosis of the other form of thyroid dysfunction, the Veteran is entitled to an initial evaluation for the newly diagnosed thyroid disease.\nReferences:  For more information on\nestablishing future exam control, see M21-1, Part IV, Subpart ii, 1.B\nstatic disabilities, see\nM21-1, Part IV, Subpart ii, 2.B.2.b, and\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.D.4, and\nevaluations of thyroid disabilities, see 38 CFR 4.119.\nV.iii.11.3.c.  Rating Thyroid Enlargement, Nontoxic\nIn the context of thyroid function, nontoxic means that thyroid function is normal. Because thyroid function is normal, the disabling effects of nontoxic thyroid enlargement are generally either manifest as disfigurement or a result of pressure on adjacent organs (such as trachea, larynx, or esophagus). Evaluate this condition based on one or both of these effects, if present.\nReference: For more information on evaluating thyroid enlargement, nontoxic, see 38 CFR 4.119, DC 7902.\nV.iii.11.3.d.  Definition: Myxedema\nMyxedema (coma or crisis) is a life-threatening form of hypothyroidism found predominantly in undiagnosed or undertreated individuals that requires inpatient hospitalization for stabilization.\nV.iii.11.3.e.  Changes in the Endocrine Rating Schedule\nOn December 10, 2017, VA implemented changes in the rating criteria under 38 CFR 4.119.  These changes should not be the basis of a reduction in a Veteran’s disability rating unless medical evidence establishes that the disability has actually improved.\nNote:  These changes in the rating criteria are not considered liberalizing.\nReferences:  For more information on\nthe effect of a rating schedule readjustment, see\n38 CFR 3.951, and\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.D.2.i, and\napplying new rating schedule criteria to increased rating claims, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 4.A.6.m.\n4.  Examples of Rating Decisions Involving the Complications of Diabetes Mellitus\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains three examples of rating decisions involving the complications of diabetes mellitus, including\nexample 1 of a rating decision involving complications of diabetes mellitus\nexample 2 of a rating decision involving complications of diabetes mellitus, and\nexample 3 of a rating decision involving complications of diabetes mellitus.\nChange Date\nDecember 13, 2005\nV.iii.11.4.a.  Example 1: Rating Decision Involving Complications of Diabetes Mellitus\nSituation:  The Veteran has noncompensable complications of diabetes mellitus but does not have ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions.\nResult:  Do not evaluate the diabetes mellitus at 60 percent simply because noncompensable complications are present.  Assign a 40-percent evaluation if there is a requirement of insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities.  Include the noncompensable complications under 38 CFR 4.119, DC 7913.\nV.iii.11.4.b.  Example 2: Rating Decision Involving Complications of Diabetes Mellitus\nSituation:  The Veteran’s diabetes mellitus is controlled by insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities.  In addition, there is diabetic peripheral neuropathy compensable at 10 percent.\nResult:  Rate the diabetes mellitus at 40 percent and separately evaluate the compensable complication of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in accordance with the note under 38 CFR 4.119, DC 7913.\nV.iii.11.4.c.  Example 3: Rating Decision Involving Complications of Diabetes Mellitus\nSituation:  The Veteran underwent a below-the-knee amputation due to complications of diabetes mellitus.  In addition\nhis diabetes mellitus requires\nmore than one daily injection of insulin\nrestricted diet, and\nregulation of activities\nhis episodes of ketoacidosis require weekly visits to the diabetic care provider, but\nthere is no progressive loss of weight and strength.\nResult:  Evaluate the diabetes mellitus at 100 percent and award SMC (k) for anatomical loss of a foot.  Since the below-the-knee amputation is secondary to diabetes mellitus, and is considered a compensable complication (in lieu of progressive loss of weight and strength), to warrant the 100-percent evaluation, it would be pyramiding to assign a separate 40-percent evaluation for the amputation.\nNote:  If compensable complications are not considered in reaching the 100- percent evaluation, they may be separately evaluated.\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, Chapter 12, Section A - Neurological Conditions and Convulsive Disorders\nArticle ID: 554400000180519\nUpdated May 28, 2025\n﻿﻿<-- Previous Section  Next Section -->\nOverview\nIn This Section\nThis section contains the following topics:\nTopic\nTopic Name\n1\nGeneral Information on Neurological and Convulsive Disorders\n2\nPeripheral Nerves\n3\nMigraine Headaches\n1.  General Information on Neurological and Convulsive Disorders\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains general information about neurological and convulsive disorders, including\nconsiderations in service connection (SC) for neurological disorders\nidentifying epilepsy\nevaluating progressive spinal muscular atrophy\nother organic diseases of the nervous system under 38 CFR 3.309(a)\nSC of vertigo, and\nrequesting examinations for manifestations of central nervous system diseases.\nChange Date\nFebruary 26, 2025\nV.iii.12.A.1.a.  Considerations in SC for Neurological Disorders\nSee the table below for etiological considerations and manifestations involving specific neurological disorders.\nWhen ...\nThen ...\nconsidering questions of incurrence or aggravation in service\nbear in mind the etiology and clinical course of each separate disease.\nconsidering conditions of infectious origin\nconsider both the circumstances of infection and the incubation period.\ndetermining aggravation for conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), progressive muscular atrophy, and myasthenia gravis\nbe aware that increased symptomatology over a period of a few months may reflect natural progression of the disease.  Base determinations on the developed medical evidence of record.\nV.iii.12.A.1.b.  Identifying Epilepsy\nSeizures must be witnessed or verified by a physician to warrant service connection (SC) for epilepsy.  Verification may be by an electroencephalogram (EEG), which measures electrical activity in the brain.\nA physician does not have to witness an actual seizure before a diagnosis of epilepsy can be accepted for evaluation purposes.  Verification by a physician based upon factors other than observing an actual seizure is sufficient.\nReferences:  For more information on\nidentifying epilepsy, see 38 CFR 4.121, and\npsychomotor epilepsy, see 38 CFR 4.122.\nV.iii.12.A.1.c.  Evaluating Progressive Spinal Muscular Atrophy\nProgressive muscular atrophy, 38 CFR 4.124a, diagnostic code (DC) 8023, refers to progressive spinal muscular atrophy, which is a disease of the spinal cord.\nProgressive muscular atrophy is subject to presumptive SC under 38 CFR 3.309(a)because it is an organic disease of the nervous system.\nV.iii.12.A.1.d.  Other Organic Diseases of the Nervous System Under 38 CFR 3.309(a)\nFor purposes of establishing presumptive SC for a chronic disease under 38 CFR 3.307, the term other organic diseases of the nervous system in 38 CFR 3.309(a) includes any commonly recognized neurological disease (such as may be found in a valid contemporary medical treatise), which is not otherwise specifically enumerated under 38 CFR 3.309(a).  This includes, but is not limited to, the following conditions:\ncarpal tunnel syndrome\nmigraine headaches\nsensorineural hearing loss\ntinnitus\nglaucoma\nprogressive spinal muscular atrophy\ndiseases of the cranial nervous system\ncranial nerve conditions, and\nperipheral nerve conditions, such as peripheral neuropathy.\nImportant:  If there is uncertainty as to whether or not a claimed disability may be considered as an organic disease of the nervous system for purposes of 38 CFR 3.309(a), send the case to Compensation Service for guidance.\nReferences:  For more information on\npresumptive SC, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 2.B\nreferring a claim for an advisory opinion, see M21-1, Part X, Subpart v, 1.A.2, and\nestablishing SC for hearing loss and tinnitus, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 2.B.\nV.iii.12.A.1.e.   SC of Vertigo\nCarefully consider the evidence of record when considering SC for vertigo.  Vertigo is generally considered a symptom of another disability such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), Meniere's disease, vestibular neuritis/labyrinthitis, MS, stroke or tumor.\nWhen the disability manifested by vertigo is adequately identified, SC should be established for that diagnosis rather than for \"vertigo.\"  However, SC can be established for \"vertigo\" in the absence of a known or established underlying etiology if there is\nan event in service (such as a nonspecific diagnosis of vertigo in service)\nvertigo present post service\na nexus establishing the vertigo post service is connected to the event in service, and\nthe condition is not associated with any other disease or injury.\nReferences:  For more information on\nevaluating vertigo as a symptom of TBI and the prohibition against evaluating vertigo separately from TBI, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 12.B.1.i, and\nprinciples related to SC, see\n38 CFR 3.303, and\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 2.\nV.iii.12.A.1.f.  Requesting Examinations for Manifestations of Central Nervous System Diseases\nAll manifestations or residuals of a central nervous system disease under 38 CFR 4.124a, DCs 8000-8025, must be examined using only the applicable disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ) for the primary or underlying central nervous system disease.  Do not request a different DBQ specifically for any manifestations or residuals, as these are accounted for in the DBQ for the primary or underlying disease.\nNote:  This applies in all cases where an examination is needed for such manifestations or residuals, even if the primary or underlying central nervous system disease itself is not at issue in the associated claim.\nException:  When the disabling manifestation requires a specialist examination, as outlined in M21-1, Part IV, Subpart i, 2.A.1.g, request the specific DBQ for the condition requiring a specialist examination.\nExample:  Do not request a Peripheral Nerves Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire for evaluation of extremity tremor and weakness due to Parkinson’s disease.  Request only the Parkinson’s Disease Disability Benefits Questionnaire, which includes an assessment for impairment of the extremities.\nReferences:  For more information on\nexamination requests, see M21-1, Part IV, Subpart i, 2.A\nprogressive neurological disorders, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 12.C, and\nDBQs, see the DBQ Switchboard.\n2.  Peripheral Nerves\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information on evaluating peripheral nerves, including\nregulations for evaluating peripheral nerves\n38 CFR 4.124a guidance on evaluating completely sensory peripheral nerve impairment\nassigning level of incomplete paralysis, neuritis, or neuralgia\nconsidering the complete findings when evaluating incomplete paralysis\nnerve branches of the lower extremities for which separate evaluations may be assigned\nassigning separate evaluations for lower extremity peripheral nerves\ndetermining individual nerves affected in the upper and lower extremities when evaluating disabilities\nelectromyography (EMG) and other tests for peripheral nerve conditions\napplying the amputation rule to peripheral nerve disabilities, and\nevaluating restless legs syndrome.\nChange Date\nApril 16, 2020\nV.iii.12.A.2.a.Regulations for Evaluating Peripheral Nerves\n38 CFR 4.124a, DCs 8510-8730, provides evaluation levels for complete paralysis, incomplete paralysis, neuritis, or neuralgia of peripheral nerves.\nAt the beginning of the DCs for the peripheral nerves, the regulation also states that “incomplete paralysis” anticipates substantially less impaired function than described for complete paralysis of the nerve.  When impairment is wholly sensory, the evaluation should be that specified for the mild, or at most, the moderatedegree of incomplete paralysis for the nerve.\nThe regulations listed below also provide guidance on evaluating peripheral nerves.\n38 CFR 4.120 provides that when rating peripheral nerve injuries and residuals consider the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, and/or sensory disturbances.  Attention should be given to the site and character of the injury.\n38 CFR 4.123 provides several principles relating to peripheral nerves:\nNeuritis, characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain, is to be rated on the scale provided for injury of the nerve involved under the DCs and evaluations provided in 38 CFR 4.124a.\nThe maximum evaluation for neuritis is the evaluation provided for severeincomplete paralysis of the affected nerve.\nThe maximum evaluation that may be assigned for neuritis not characterized by the organic changes referred to in the regulation\nis generally the evaluation level specified for moderateincomplete paralysis of the nerve, but\nis the evaluation level specified for moderately severeimpairment when the affected nerve is the sciatic nerve.\n38 CFR 4.124 provides that the maximum evaluation for neuralgia, characterized usually by a dull and intermittent pain in the distribution of a nerve, should be the evaluation provided for moderate incomplete paralysis of the nerve under the applicable DC.\nV.iii.12.A.2.b.      38 CFR 4.124a Guidance on Evaluating Completely Sensory Peripheral Nerve Impairment\nIn cases where a peripheral nerve disability is only manifested by sensory impairment, 38 CFR 4.124a directs decision makers to assign the evaluation corresponding with the mild or at most the moderate degree of impairment.\nTo make a choice between mild and moderate, consider the evidence of record and the following guidelines:\nThe mild level of evaluation would be more reasonably assigned when sensory symptoms are\nrecurrent but not continuous\nassigned a lower medical grade reflecting less impairment, and/or\naffecting a smaller area in the nerve distribution.\nReserve the moderate level of evaluation for the most significant and disabling cases of sensory-only involvement.  These are cases where the sensory symptoms are\ncontinuous\nassigned a higher medical grade reflecting greater impairment, and/or\naffecting a larger area in the nerve distribution.\nImportant:  This provision does not mean that if there is any impairment that is non-sensory (or involves a non-sensory component) such as a reflex abnormality, weakness, or muscle atrophy, the disability must be evaluated as greater than moderate.  Significant and widespread sensory impairment may potentially indicate the same or even more disability than a case involving a minimally reduced or increased reflex or minimally reduced strength.\nReferences:  For more information on\nevaluating wholly sensory manifestations of peripheral nerves, see Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet.App. 376 (2017)\nconsidering the complete findings when evaluating incomplete paralysis, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 12.A.2.d\nthe importance of fully descriptive examinations and limitations from the disabling condition, see 38 CFR 4.1, and\nthe importance of coordinating the evaluation with impairment of function based on sufficiently characteristic findings, see 38 CFR 4.21.\nV.iii.12.A.2.c.  Assigning Level of Incomplete Paralysis, Neuritis, or Neuralgia\nThe table below provides general guidelines for each level of incomplete paralysis of the upper and lower peripheral nerves.\nDegree of Incomplete Paralysis\nDescription\nMild\nAs this is the lowest level of evaluation for each nerve, this is the default assigned based on the symptoms, however slight, as long as they were sufficient to support a diagnosis of the peripheral nerve impairment for SC purposes.\nIn general, look for a disability limited to sensory deficits that are lower graded, less persistent, or affecting a small area.\nA very minimal reflex or motor abnormality potentially could also be consistent with mild incomplete paralysis.\nModerate﻿﻿\nModerate is the maximum evaluation reserved for the most significant cases of sensory-only impairment (38 CFR 4.124a).\nSymptoms will likely be described by the claimants and medically graded as significantly disabling.\nIn such cases a larger area in the nerve distribution may be affected by sensory symptoms.\nOther sign/symptom combinations that may fall into the moderate category include\ncombinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or\nmotor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate.\nModerate is also the maximum evaluation that can be assigned for\nneuritis not characterized by organic changes referred to in 38 CFR 4.123, or\nneuralgia characterized usually by a dull and intermittent pain in the distribution of a nerve (38 CFR 4.124).\nModerately Severe\nThe moderately severe evaluation level is only applicable for involvement of the sciatic nerve.\nThis is the maximum rating for sciatic nerve neuritis not characterized by the organic changes specified in 38 CFR 4.123.\nMotor and/or reflex impairment (for example, weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a high level of limitation or disability is expected.\nAtrophy may be present.  However, for marked muscular atrophy see the criteria for a severe evaluation under 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8520.\nSevere\nIn general, expect motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, atrophy, weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability.\nTrophic changes may be seen in severe longstanding neuropathy cases.\nFor the sciatic nerve (38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8520) marked muscular atrophy is expected.\nEven though severe incomplete paralysis cases should show findings substantially less than representative findings for complete impairment of the nerve, the disability picture for severe incomplete paralysis may contain signs/symptoms resembling some of those expected in cases of complete paralysis of the nerve.\nNeuritis characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain should be rated as high as severe incomplete paralysis of the nerve (38 CFR 4.123).\nNotes:\nAlways consider the specific criteria in the 38 CFR 4.124a DC at issue, as well as the general guidance on neuritis and neuralgia under 38 CFR 4.123 and 38 CFR 4.124.\nThis guidance also applies to radiculopathy, which is evaluated under a peripheral nerve code.\nSeparate evaluations may not be assigned when evaluating an upper extremity peripheral nerve disability. See note under 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8719.\nReference:  For more information on evaluating peripheral nerves, see the Peripheral Nerve Evaluation Matrix.\nV.iii.12.A.2.d.  Considering the Complete Findings When Evaluating Incomplete Paralysis\nEvaluation Builder entries must be based upon the complete findings of the DBQ and/or evidentiary record, including\nthe nerve(s) involved\nwhether the impairment involves\nreduced or elevated sensation to various tests, or abnormal sensations\nreduced or hyperactive reflexes\nmuscle weakness\nmuscle atrophy, and/or\ntrophic changes\nthe amount of area in the nerve distribution affected by symptoms\nthe frequency of symptoms, and\nthe grade of any impairments that are identified.\nDo not base the entries solely upon the examiner’s assessment of the level of incomplete paralysis.\nThe examiner’s clinical assessment of the extent of incomplete paralysis, as indicated on the DBQ, may be inconsistent with or appear to contradict the objective findings that are documented in other sections of the DBQ or other evidence of record.\nImportant:  The rating activity, not the examining medical professional, determines whether the overall evidentiary record shows the severity of the condition meets the criteria for a classification of mild, moderate, moderately severe, or severe.\nExample 1:  An examiner assesses the peripheral nerve disability as “mild incomplete paralysis.”  However, the DBQ shows muscle weakness, atrophy, and diminished reflexes, which are clearly demonstrative of more than mild incomplete paralysis.  In this case, the complete evidentiary record shows the condition is more than mild under guidance contained in 38 CFR 4.124 and therefore warrants a higher evaluation.\nExample 2:  An examiner renders an assessment of “severe incomplete paralysis” when the objective test results are wholly sensory.  Therefore, the condition warrants an evaluation no higher than moderate incomplete paralysis under 38 CFR 4.124a.\nReferences:  For more information on\ntests for peripheral nerve conditions, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 12.A.2.h, and\ninterpretation of examination reports, see 38 CFR 4.2.\nV.iii.12.A.2.e.Nerve Branches of the Lower Extremities for Which Separate Evaluations May Be Assigned\nThe table below lists the five nerve branches of the lower extremities for which separate evaluations may be assigned.  See M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 12.A.2.ffor rating guidance on assigning separate evaluations for nerve conditions of the lower extremities.\nTo assist in evaluating these nerves, the table below also includes any associated nerves in each branch, corresponding DCs under 38 CFR 4.124a, and the general functions covered by each nerve branch.\nLower Extremity Nerve Branches\nFunction\nSciatic\nsciatic nerve (DCs 8520, 8620, and 8720)\nexternal popliteal nerve (common peroneal) (DCs 8521, 8621, and 8721)\nmusculocutaneous nerve (superficial peroneal) (DCs 8522, 8622, and 8722)\nanterior tibial nerve (deep peroneal) (DCs 8523, 8623, and 8723)\ninternal popliteal nerve (tibial) (DCs 8524, 8624, and 8724), and\nposterior tibial nerve (DCs 8525, 8625, and 8725).\nFoot and leg sensory and motor function of the\nbuttock\nleg\nknee\nmuscles below knee\nlower leg\nfibula\nfoot, muscles of foot, sole of foot, plantar flexion, and\ntoes.\nFemoral\nanterior

8629, and 8729)\nSensory function of the lateral thigh.\nIlio-inguinal nerve (DCs 8530, 8630, and 8730)\nMotor and sensory function of the\nlower abdominal wall\nthigh\nscrotum, and\nlabia majora.\nV.iii.12.A.2.f.  Assigning Separate Evaluations for Lower Extremity Peripheral Nerves\nUnlike the upper extremities, separate evaluations of the lower extremities may be assigned for symptoms that are separate and distinct, do not overlap, and are attributed to different lower extremity nerves.  This means that separate evaluations are warranted when symptoms arise from any of the five nerve branches listed in the table in M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 12.A.2.e.\nIf symptoms arise from within the same nerve branch of any of the five individual nerve branches in the lower extremity, assigning separate evaluations for those symptoms are not warranted as this would constitute pyramiding.\nExample 1:  Separate Evaluations Warranted\nA Veteran has severe incomplete paralysis of the common peroneal nerve and mild incomplete paralysis of the femoral nerve.  Assign separate evaluations of 30 percent under 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8521 and 10 percent under 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8526.\nAnalysis:  The common peroneal nerve is part of the sciatic branch and the femoral nerve is part of the femoral branch.  The functions for these branches are separate and distinct and therefore warrant separate evaluations.\nExample 2:  Separate Evaluations Not Warranted\nA Veteran has severe incomplete paralysis of the common peroneal nerve under 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8521 and moderate incomplete paralysis of the tibial nerveunder 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8524.  In this case, a single 30-percent evaluation is assigned under 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8521.\nAnalysis:  Both of these nerves are part of the same sciatic branch, and therefore the functions associated with these nerves are not separate and distinct.  The 30-percent evaluation shall be assigned under 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8521 since it represents the predominant disability.\nReferences:  For more information on\nseparate evaluations and pyramiding, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.D.2.b, and\nnerve branches of the lower extremities, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 12.A.2.e.\nV.iii.12.A.2.g.  Determining Individual Nerves Affected in the Upper and Lower Extremities When Evaluating Disabilities\nWhen evaluating peripheral nerve disabilities of the upper and lower extremities, the rating activity must conduct a thorough review of the medical evidence of record to determine the individual nerve(s) affected.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) examiners are required, to the extent possible, to select the individual nerves affected when completing DBQs.  However, the examiner may not necessarily conduct a review of all previous clinical records or perform comprehensive tests to pinpoint the exact nerve and/or symptoms attributable to that nerve.\nImportant:\nIt is the responsibility of the rating activity, in accordance with 38 CFR 4.2, to interpret the DBQ along with the whole recorded history, and accurately identify and assess the current level of peripheral nerve disability.  This includes identifying the appropriate nerve from a review of the evidence so that the appropriate evaluation can be assigned.\nInclude the following language in all peripheral nerves examination requests:\nExaminer:  Please identify the specific nerve(s) affected.  If you are unable to identify the specific nerve(s), please provide a rationale in the Remarks section.  Thank you.\nFollow the guidance in the table below when reviewing medical evidence pertaining to peripheral nerve disabilities of the upper and lower extremities.\nIf the DBQ or equivalent indicates …\nAnd …\nThen evaluate …\nthe specific nerve(s) affected\nthere is no conflicting information\nthe specific nerve under the appropriate DC.\nthere is conflicting information on what nerve is affected, but the nerves identified are within the same nerve branch\nthe nerve that is most beneficial to the Veteran as long as the DC supports the symptoms.\nthe identified nerves are in different nerve branches; however, the symptoms identified in the medical evidence are not clearly associated with an individual nerve\nall symptoms shown in the medical evidence for the individual nerve(s) in the associated nerve branches.\nthe examiner is unable to specify the affected nerve(s)\nthere is no other evidence adequately documenting the affected nerve\nupper extremity symptoms using 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8514 (the radial nerve), or\nlower extremity symptoms using 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8521 (the common peroneal nerve).\nException:  Where the disability at issue is lower extremity radiculopathy associated with service-connected (SC) thoracolumbar disability, follow the guidance in M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 1.B.3.d and evaluate using 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8520 (the sciatic nerve).\nNote:  The nerve branches and general functions of the nerve branches of the lower extremities are described in the table found in M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 12.A.2.e.\nV.iii.12.A.2.h.   EMG and Other Tests for Peripheral Nerve Conditions\nElectromyography (EMG) results are required for evaluations of peripheral nerve disabilities unless there is a previous EMG test of record or the record contains sufficient clinical evidence to determine the extent of paralysis in the peripheral nerve.\nAs noted in the Peripheral Nerves Conditions (Not Including Diabetic Sensory - Motor Peripheral Neuropathy) Disability Benefits Questionnaire, EMG studies are usually rarely required to diagnose specific peripheral nerve conditions in the appropriate clinical setting and, if EMG studies are in the medical record and reflect the Veteran's current condition, repeat studies are not indicated.\nImportant:  Ultimately, it is the role of the rating activity to determine if the examination was sufficient to confirm the question and extent of peripheral nerve involvement.\nNote:  Other clinical findings that may be sufficient to document a peripheral nerve disability include\nsensation to light touch testing\ndeep tendon reflex testing\ncertain signs for the median nerve\ntrophic changes\ngait testing\nmuscle strength testing, and\nthe presence of muscle atrophy.\nV.iii.12.A.2.i.   Applying the Amputation Rule to Peripheral Nerve Disabilities\nIn determining whether the amputation rule under 38 CFR 4.68 applies to peripheral nerve evaluations, decision makers must consider the etiology of the peripheral nerve disability.\nIf the peripheral nerve disability is associated with a musculoskeletal injury or amputation, follow the guidance in M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 1.E.2.j regarding the application of the amputation rule.\nWhen peripheral nerve disabilities are not associated with a musculoskeletal injury, such as diabetic neuropathy, the amputation rule does not apply.\nReference:  For more information on evaluating peripheral nerve injuries associated with a muscle injury, see 38 CFR 4.55.\nV.iii.12.A.2.j.  Evaluating Restless Legs Syndrome\nRestless legs syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by throbbing, pulling, creeping, or other unpleasant sensations in the legs and an uncontrollable, and sometimes overwhelming, urge to move them.  Symptoms occur primarily at night when a person is relaxing or at rest and can increase in severity during the night.\nRestless legs syndrome should be rated under the appropriate peripheral neuropathy code(s) that most closely approximates the area of the extremity or extremities affected by the distribution of the symptoms.\n3.  Migraine Headaches\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information on migraine headaches, including\nevaluation criteria for migraine headaches\nDC 8100 terminology: prostrating and completely prostrating\nrole of medical evidence in establishing the fact of prostration\nlay evidence of prostration from migraine headaches\nDC 8100 terminology:\nsevere economic inadaptability, and\nless frequent and very frequent\nfrequency determinations: types of proof, and\nheadache journals.\nChange Date\nSeptember 14, 2023\nV.iii.12.A.3.a.  Evaluation Criteria for Migraine Headaches\nMigraine headaches are evaluated under the criteria of 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8100.  Evaluations depend primarily on the frequency of attacks and the degree to which symptoms are prostrating.  The extent to which the headaches cause work impairment is also a factor and is considered for the 50-percent evaluation.\nImportant:  The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, in Holmes v. Wilkie, 33 Vet.App. 67 (2020), held that the criteria of 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8100, contemplate more than merely headache symptoms, and that the DC requires VA to\nconsider all symptoms experienced as a result of migraine attacks, and\nevaluate those symptoms based on the overall frequency, severity, and economic impact of the migraine attacks.\nExample:  A Veteran suffers SC migraine headaches that occur twice weekly and are prostrating in nature.  Symptoms manifested during the migraine headache attacks include frontal headaches, photophobia, nausea, and dizziness.  In evaluating the disability under 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8100, VA must consider all symptoms associated with the migraine headache attacks, and not just the headaches themselves.\nV.iii.12.A.3.b.   DC 8100 Terminology:  Prostrating and Completely Prostrating\nProstrating, as used in 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8100, means “causing extreme exhaustion, powerlessness, debilitation or incapacitation with substantial inability to engage in ordinary activities.”\nCompletely prostrating, as used in 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8100, means extreme exhaustion or powerlessness with essentially total inability to engage in ordinary activities.\nV.iii.12.A.3.c.  The Role of Medical Evidence in Establishing the Fact of Prostration\nAlthough prostration is substantially defined by how the disabled individual subjectively feels and functions when having migraine headache symptoms, medical evidence is required to establish that the reported symptoms are due to the SC migraine headaches.\nThe following is an example of a medical statement that would ordinarily establish the fact of prostration if the medical report and the history provided by the claimant are both credible.\nThe patient reports symptoms of severe head pain, blurred vision, nausea and vomiting, and being unable to tolerate light or noise, worsened by most activities including reading, writing, and engaging in conversations or physical activities.  When experiencing these symptoms, the patient only sleeps or rests.  The symptoms reported by the patient are consistent with the diagnosis of migraine headaches and the reported limitations are consistent with those seen in patients suffering from migraine headaches of similar clinical severity.\nNote:  Medical reports may not use the word “prostration.”  However, this is an adjudicative determination based on the extent to which the facts meet the definition of the term.\nV.iii.12.A.3.d.  Lay Evidence of Prostration from Migraine Headaches\nA claimant’s own testimony regarding symptoms and limitations when having those symptoms can establish prostration as long as the testimony is credible and symptoms are otherwise competently attributed to migraine headaches through medical evidence.\nExample:  A claimant provides testimony that she 1) experiences severe headaches and vomiting when exposed to light; 2) does not engage in any activities when this occurs; and 3) must rest or sleep during these episodes.  If there is medical evidence that the claimant’s description of symptoms is in fact symptoms of migraine headaches, a determination that the headaches cause prostration can be made.\nReference:  For more information on competency of lay testimony, see\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 1.B, and\nEspiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet.App. 492 (1992).\nV.iii.12.A.3.e.  DC 8100 Terminology: Severe Economic Inadaptability\nSevere economic inadaptability denotes a degree of substantial work impairment.  It does not mean the individual is incapable of any substantially gainful employment.  Evidence of work impairment includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the use of sick leave or unpaid absence.\nNote:  In cases where migraine headaches meet the criterion of severe economic inadaptability and, additionally, the evidence shows that the claimant is incapable of substantially gainful employment due to the headaches, referral for consideration of an extraschedular award of a total evaluation based on individual unemployability is appropriate.\nReference:  For more information on severe economic inadaptability, see Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet.App 440 (2004).\nV.iii.12.A.3.f.  DC 8100 Terminology: Less Frequent and Very Frequent\n38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8100 does not define the terms less frequent for the 0- percent criterion or very frequent for the 50-percent criterion.  However, the overall rating criteria structure for migraine headaches provides a basis for guidance.\nAs noted in 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8100, the 10-percent evaluation specifies average frequency (“averaging one in 2 months over the last several months”), which is half of what is required for a 30-percent evaluation (“on average once a month over the last several months”).\nFor definitions of the terms less frequent and very frequent, refer to the table below.\nTerm\nEvaluation Level\nDefinition\nless frequent\n0 percent\nCharacteristic prostrating attacks, on average, are more than two months apart over the last several months.\nvery frequent\n50 percent\nCharacteristic prostrating attacks, on average, are less than one month apart over the last several months.\nV.iii.12.A.3.g.  Frequency Determinations:  Types of Proof\nFrequency of migraine headache attacks or episodes is a factual determination.  Analyze all evidence in the record bearing on the question.\nProbative evidence may include\nmedical progress notes\ncompetent and credible lay evidence on how often the claimant experiences symptoms (as long as those symptoms have been competently identified as symptoms of migraine headaches)\ncontemporaneous notes (a headache journal)\nprescription refills, and\nwitness statements.\nNote:  The absence of treatment reports is not necessarily probative on the question of headache frequency as a claimant may not seek treatment for headaches during every episode.\nReference:  For more information on evaluating evidence, including competency and credibility, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 1.\nV.iii.12.A.3.h.  Headache Journals\nHeadache journals, which routinely and relatively contemporaneously record headache episodes, may be accepted as credible lay testimony regarding\nheadache frequency\nprostration, and\noccupational impairment (for example, sick leave due to headaches).\nNote:  Headaches recorded on non-work days may be used to prove frequency and prostration.  However, they will not generally be relevant to work availability, and performance or limitations, which are considerations in determining severe economic inadaptability.\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, Chapter 12, Section B - Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)\nArticle ID: 554400000180832\nUpdated Dec 29, 2025\n<-- Previous Section  Next Section -->\nOverview\nIn This Section\nThis section contains the following topics:\nTopic\nTopic Name\n1\nGeneral Information About TBI\n2\nRating Considerations for TBI\n3\nSecondary Conditions Associated With TBI Under 38 CFR 3.310(d)\n1.   General Information About TBI\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains general information about TBI, including\ndefinition of TBI\nTBI events\nexternal force for the purpose of TBI events\nregistry for verifying blast injuries\nTBI residuals\ndetermining the issues in TBI cases\ntraining and signature requirements for TBI decisions, and\nTBI special issue.\nChange Date\nAugust 11, 2025\nV.iii.12.B.1.a.  Definition: TBI\nThe term traumatic brain injury (TBI) means the physical, cognitive, and/or behavioral/emotional residual disability resulting from an event of external force causing an injury to the brain.\nV.iii.12.B.1.b.    TBI Events\nThe TBI event is a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function resulting from an external force indicated by at least oneof the following clinical signs immediately following the event:\nany period of loss of consciousness or decreased consciousness\nany loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury\nany alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.)\nneurological deficits, whether or not transient, or\nintracranial lesion.\nNotes:\nThe TBI event has two necessary components: the external force and the identifiable acute manifestations of brain injury immediately following the external force.  Not all individuals exposed to an external force will have brain injury, and therefore, they will not meet the criteria for having a TBI event.\nThe acute manifestations may resolve without chronic disability, or a chronic disability may result.\nAlthough unconsciousness or reduced consciousness is common in TBI events, these are not required.  Any one of the five signs will be sufficient.\nV.iii.12.B.1.c.  External Force for the Purpose of TBI Events\nExternal force means any of the following events:\na foreign body (such as a bullet or shell fragment) penetrating the brain\nthe head being struck by an object (such as a fist, a hatch, or flying debris)\nthe head striking an object (such as the ground or a windshield)\nthe brain undergoing an acceleration/deceleration movement without direct external trauma to the head\nforce generated from events such as a blast or explosion, to include low-level blasts or explosions from firing heavy weapons systems or explosives, such as\nartillery weapons, or\nshoulder-launched missiles, or\nother force yet to be defined.\nNote:  TBI events may occur during combat or non-combat situations (such as a motor vehicle accident, fall, or personal assault).\nV.iii.12.B.1.d.  Registry for Verifying Blast Injuries\nThe U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command Joint Trauma Analysis and Prevention of Injury in Combat (JTAPIC) has developed a registry of service members who were within 50 feet of a blast since mid-2010.\nWhen existing Department of War records, to include service treatment records (STRs), are not sufficient to verify exposure to a blast injury that occurred since mid-2010, Compensation Service will contact JTAPIC to determine if there is a record of exposure.\nImportant:  E-mail Compensation Service at VAVBAWAS/CO/214DADVISORYANDSRT if exposure to an in-service blast injury from mid-2010 to the present cannot be verified.  Include the following information in the e-mail:\nfull name of Veteran\nclaim number and Social Security number\nbranch of service\nbrief description of the blast injury\nlocation\ndate of blast/injury, and\nunit.\nV.iii.12.B.1.e.    TBI Residuals\nThe resultant disabling effects of a TBI event beyond those that follow immediately from the acute injury to the brain are known as TBI residuals or TBI sequelae.\nThe signs and symptoms of TBI residuals can be organized into the three main categories of physical, cognitive, and behavioral/emotional residuals for evaluation purposes.  Examples of TBI residuals in each of the three categories may include, but are not limited to, those listed below.\nPhysical\nCognitive\nBehavioral/Emotional\nApraxia (inability to execute purposeful, previously learned motor tasks, despite physical ability and willingness)\nDementias (pre-senile Alzheimer's type, dementia pugilistica, post traumatic dementia)\nDepression\nAphasia (difficulty communicating orally and/or in writing)\nAttention and concentration deficits\nAgitation and irritability\nParesis (muscle weakness or incomplete paralysis)\nMemory, processing, and learning impairment\nImpulsivity\nPlegia (paralysis or stroke)\nLanguage deficiencies\nAggression\nDysphagia (difficulty swallowing)\nPlanning difficulties\nAnxiety\nDisorders of balance and coordination\nJudgment and control difficulties\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\nDiseases of hormone deficiency\nReasoning and abstract thinking limitations\nParkinsonism\nSelf-awareness limitations\nNausea/vomiting\nHeadaches\nDizziness\nBlurred vision\nSeizure disorder\nSensory loss\nWeakness\nSleep disturbance\nNote:  TBI residuals can resolve in a short period of time or can persist chronically or even permanently. Chronic TBI residuals may include some or all of the clinical signs that developed immediately during the TBI event. Others (such as seizures or spasticity) may have a delayed onset.\nV.iii.12.B.1.f.  Determining the Issues in TBI Cases\nA claim for service connection (SC) for TBI may also be worded as a claim for “head injury” or “concussion.”  A claim document mentioning any of the above must be sympathetically read and understood as a claim for all identifiable TBI residuals that can be attributed to one or more TBI events.\nA claim for “combat injuries,” assault, automobile accident, fall, or other injurious events may also raise the issue of a TBI if there was an injury to the head.\nAs recognized by 38 CFR 4.124a, diagnostic code (DC) 8045, the external force of a claimed TBI event may result not only in brain injury but also in physical or psychological disorders distinct from brain injury residuals.  An explosion, for example, may cause burns, muscle injuries, orthopedic injuries including amputations, and PTSD in addition to a brain injury.  A TBI claim mentioning a specific traumatic event must be sympathetically read as a claim for SC for alldisabling chronic residuals of the event.\nReference:  For more information on determining the issues, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.A.\nV.iii.12.B.1.g.  Training and Signature Requirements for TBI Decisions\nAll decisions that address TBI as an issue, including rating decisions, Statements of the Case, and Supplemental Statements of the Case, must only be worked/reviewed by a Rating Veterans Service Representative or Decision Review Officer who has completed the required TBI training.\nDecisions for TBI require two signatures until a decision maker has demonstrated an accuracy rate of 90 percent or greater based on a review of at least 10 TBI cases.\nReferences:  For more information on\ntwo-signature

information about rating considerations for TBI, including\nSC of TBI residuals\nevaluation of TBI residuals\nmultiple evaluations and pyramiding in TBI cases\nevaluating TBI and comorbid symptoms/conditions\nexample of evaluating TBI with comorbid conditions\nopinion evidence and separate evaluations of TBI and a mental disorder\nadditional TBI signs or symptoms upon reevaluation\nTBI and special monthly compensation (SMC)\ntemporary total evaluations and TBI\napplicability of 38 CFR 3.114(a) in TBI cases, and\nanoxic brain injury.\nChange Date\nAugust 11, 2025\nV.iii.12.B.2.a.     SC of TBI Residuals\nBrain injuries, even if mild, cause permanent changes within the brain.  Even if residual impairment is not detected upon examination, the brain has been damaged in some way that is permanent in nature.  When there is a current formal diagnosis of TBI and a positive nexus linking the diagnosis to the in-service injury, 38 CFR 3.303 allows for SC on a direct basis, even when the current examination indicates the TBI is not manifesting any current signs or symptoms or that it is resolved.\nNotes:\nTBI residuals can manifest years after the initial injury.\nA medical opinion is necessary when the medical evidence of record does not show a clear-cut etiology for a sign or symptom claimed as a delayed effect.\nExample:  A Veteran files a new claim for SC of TBI in December 2019.  The Veteran's service records show a mild head injury in 2010.  On the Initial Evaluation of Residuals of Traumatic Brain Injury Disability Benefits Questionnaire, the examiner selects the TBI diagnosis and marks all facets as normal.  Post-service medical records do not show any complaints of disabling signs or symptoms.\nResult:  Grant SC for TBI under 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8045, 0 percent.\nV.iii.12.B.2.b.   Evaluation of TBI Residuals\nEvaluate service-connected (SC) TBI residuals under 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8045.\nIn every case, one evaluation should be assigned using the highest level of impairment assigned to any facet contained in the table “Evaluation of Cognitive Impairment and Other Residuals of TBI Not Otherwise Classified,” which has been incorporated into VBMS – Rating (VBMS-R).\nAdditional evaluations may be appropriate to assign as provided in M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 12.B.2.c and d.\nNote:  A medical classification of severity of the TBI at the time of the acute traumafrom the TBI event has no bearing on evaluation for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation purposes.  It is not an evaluation factor and is not relevant to the application of the benefit of the doubt rule.  Do not imply or state that initial severity classification was given weight in assigning a disability evaluation.\nReferences:  For more information on\nevaluating secondary TBI-related conditions, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 12.B.3, and\nprinciples of evaluating evidence and decision making, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 1.A.\nV.iii.12.B.2.c.Multiple Evaluations and Pyramiding in TBI Cases\nIn addition to the evaluation for TBI manifestations under the table “Evaluation of Cognitive Impairment and Other Residuals of TBI Not Otherwise Classified” in 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8045 (and also incorporated into VBMS-R), manifestations of a comorbid mental, neurologic, or other physical disorder can be separately evaluated under another DC if there is a distinct diagnosis – even if based on subjective symptoms – and no more than one evaluation is based on the same manifestation(s).\nFollow the policy in the table below.\nIf manifestations ...\nThen ...\nare clearly separable\nassign a separate evaluation using each applicable DC.\nof two or more conditions cannot be clearly separated\nassign a single evaluation under whichever set of criteria allows the better assessment of the overall impaired functioning due to both conditions.\nReferences:  For more information on\nevaluating TBI and comorbid symptoms, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 12.B.2.d\nthe importance of examiner qualifications for initial TBI examinations, see M21-1, Part IV, Subpart i, 3.A.1.j\nSC for vertigo, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 12.A.1.e, and\npyramiding, see\n38 CFR 4.14\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.D.2.b, and\nEsteban v. Brown, 6 Vet.App. 259 (1994).\nV.iii.12.B.2.d.  Evaluating TBI and Comorbid Symptoms/ Conditions\nUse the table below when evaluating TBI and comorbid symptoms and/or conditions.\nIf the Veteran has ...\nThen evaluate ...\nheadaches\nheadaches according to the table below.\nIf the Veteran has …\nThen …\nsubjective complaints of headaches\nevaluate the subjective complaints as part of the TBI evaluation under 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8045 rather than under a separate DC.\nNote:  Occasional subjective headaches are not a distinct comorbid diagnosis.\na distinct comorbid diagnosis of a headache disorder\nExamples:  Migraine headaches, post-concussive headaches, tension headaches\nassign a separate evaluation under 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8100 as long as the manifestations do not overlap with those used to assign the evaluation of TBI under 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8045.\ntinnitus\ntinnitus based on one of the following methods, depending on which method results in a higher evaluation:\nseparately under 38 CFR 4.87, DC 6260, or\nin the subjective symptoms facet under 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8045.\nvertigo (whether referred to as “vertigo,” “constant vertigo,” “peripheral vestibular disorder,” “benign paroxysmal positional vertigo,” or any other similar wording)\nvertigo in the subjective symptoms facet under 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8045.\nNote:  If vertigo was awarded a separate compensable evaluation prior to March 15, 2012, do not change or correct the evaluation.\nReference:  For more information on SC for vertigo, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 12.A.1.e.\ncognitive and/or behavioral/emotional residuals\nthe symptoms according to the table below.\nIf …\nThen …\nthe Veteran has subjective feelings of anxiety, depression, or other mental complaints\nevaluate in the subjective symptoms facet under 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8045.\nNote:  Subjective mental complaints are not a distinct comorbid diagnosis.\nthe Veteran has a comorbid mental disorder and/or neurocognitive disorder, and\nthe examiner is able to delineate both\nsymptoms, and\noccupational and social impairment\nassign separate evaluations for\nthe mental disorder symptoms and/or neurocognitive disorder symptoms under the appropriate 38 CFR 4.130 DC, and\nthe TBI symptoms under 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8045.\nthe Veteran has a comorbid mental disorder or neurocognitive disorder, and\nthe examiner is unable to delineate both\nsymptoms, and\noccupational and social impairment\nassign a single evaluation under the DC (either under 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8045 or the appropriate 38 CFR 4.130 DC) that provides the higher evaluation based on overall impaired functioning due to both conditions.\nNote:  This guidance applies to all cognitive and behavioral/emotional TBI residuals as defined in M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 12.B.1.e.  If separate and distinct physical symptoms due to TBI are present, evaluate them in the subjective or other applicable facet under 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8045, as long as the physical symptoms are not the basis of an evaluation under another DC.\nV.iii.12.B.2.e.  Example of Evaluating TBI With Comorbid Conditions\nSituation:  VA examination shows the Veteran\nhas numerous behavioral/emotional symptoms (depression that severely affects the Veteran's work and family relationships, frequent suicidal thoughts, confusion, apathy, and unpredictability), and\nmeets the diagnostic criteria for both TBI and major depression.\nThe examiner was unable to delineate which behavioral/emotional symptoms are associated with TBI and which are associated with major depression.  Evaluation under 38 CFR 4.130 criteria would result in the higher evaluation for the behavioral/emotional symptoms due to TBI and major depression.\nIn addition, the TBI examination found multiple physical complaints related to TBI, including vertigo, sensitivity to light, blurred vision, and subjective headaches.\nResult:\nAssign an evaluation for the behavioral/emotional residuals due to TBI and major depression under 38 CFR 4.130, DC 9434, as this provides the highest evaluation based on the behavioral/emotional symptoms.\nAssign a separate evaluation under 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8045 for the remaining physical symptoms and combine the evaluations under 38 CFR 4.25.\nExplanation:  Separate evaluations are warranted in this case because the physical symptoms of TBI are clearly separable from the behavioral/emotional symptoms.  The physical symptoms\nclearly represent different functional impairment than the behavioral/emotional symptoms, and\nare not compensated under the mental disorders criteria.\nV.iii.12.B.2.f.  Opinion Evidence and Separate Evaluations of TBI and a Mental Disorder\nEnsure that sufficiently clear and unequivocal medical opinion evidence exists in the claims folder whenever there is a question of whether TBI and a mental disorder are distinct and can be separately evaluated.  Veterans Benefits Administration decision makers are not qualified to make such determinations.\nThe opinion may be provided by either an examiner assessing the TBI or an examiner assessing the mental disorder as long as the individual offering the opinion is properly qualified.\nIf a medical provider cannot make the required determination without resorting to mere speculation, then careful consideration must be given to whether that statement can be accepted under Jones v. Shinseki, 23 Vet.App. 382 (2010).\nV.iii.12.B.2.g.  Additional TBI Signs or Symptoms Upon Reevaluation\nWhen considering a claim for reevaluation of TBI, do not automatically concede that a new sign, symptom, or diagnosis is a residual of TBI simply because it is listed in M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 12.B.1.e or in the evaluation criteria.\nIf there is not competent evidence that the sign, symptom, or diagnosis is associated with the SC TBI, obtain medical clarification.\nV.iii.12.B.2.h.   TBI and SMC\nBrain injuries may be associated with loss of use of an extremity, sensory impairments, erectile dysfunction, need for regular aid and attendance (A&A) (including need for protection from hazards of the daily living environment due to cognitive impairment), and being factually housebound or statutorily housebound.\nCarefully consider eligibility for special monthly compensation (SMC) when evaluating TBI residuals.\nReferences:  For more information on\nSMC, see M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 4.A\nthe special SMC rate for TBI, specified in 38 U.S.C. 1114(t), see\n38 CFR 3.350(j), and\nM21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 4.A.11, and\nordering examinations and other development for SMC (t), see M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart iv, 4.A.11.b.\nV.iii.12.B.2.i.  Temporary Total Evaluations and TBI\nIn cases of recently discharged Veterans, consider the applicability of a temporary 50-percent or 100-percent prestabilization evaluation under the provisions of 38 CFR 4.28.\nLengthy VA hospitalizations or surgeries with convalescence may also implicate consideration of eligibility for temporary total evaluation under 38 CFR 4.29 and 38 CFR 4.30.\nV.iii.12.B.2.j.  Applicability of 38 CFR 3.114(a) in TBI Cases\nThe rating criteria for evaluating TBI were changed effective October 23, 2008.\nUnder Note (5) of 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8045, a Veteran whose residuals of TBI are rated under a version of the diagnostic criteria in effect before October 23, 2008, may request review under the current regulation irrespective of whether the disability has worsened since the last review.  A request for review pursuant to this note will be treated as a claim for an increased rating for purposes of determining the effective date of an increased rating awarded as a result of such review, applying 38 CFR 3.114(a) as applicable.  However, in no case will the award be effective before October 23, 2008.\nReference:  For more information on liberalizing changes of law and VA issues, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 4.A.6.\nV.iii.12.B.2.k.  Anoxic Brain Injury\nAnoxic brain injury is a condition resulting from a severe decrease in the oxygen supply to the brain that may be due to any of a number of possible etiologies, including trauma, strangulation, carbon monoxide poisoning, stroke, and many others.\nAs anoxic brain injury does not have its own unique DC in the rating schedule, it can be rated analogously, depending on the specific medical findings in a particular case.\nUse the table below to determine the possible analogous rating.\nIf the residuals are similar to ...\nThen evaluate the symptoms analogous to ...\nTBI\n38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8045.\nbrain hemorrhage\n38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8009.\npsychiatric disability\n38 CFR 4.130, DC 9310.\nnerve damage\none or more DCs for specific nerves that are affected.\nImportant:  Follow the guidance in M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 12.B.2.c and dwhen considering the assignment of multiple evaluations for residuals.\n3.  Secondary Conditions Associated With TBI Under 38 CFR 3.310(d)\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information on secondary conditions associated with SC TBI, including\nsecondary SC under 38 CFR 3.310\nevaluating the initial severity of TBI\nusing the TBI initial severity table in 38 CFR 3.310\nevidence that may be relevant to the initial severity factors\ndetermination of diagnosable conditions as secondary to TBI\nconsiderations when establishing secondary SC\naction when evidence shows a 38 CFR 3.310(d) condition, and\ndetermining effective dates for secondary conditions.\nChange Date\nAugust 11, 2025\nV.iii.12.B.3.a.  Secondary SC Under 38 CFR 3.310\n38 CFR 3.310(d) was amended on December 17, 2013, to establish an association between TBI and certain illnesses.\nIn absence of clear evidence to the contrary, the following five diagnosable illnesses are held to be a secondary result of TBI:\nParkinsonism, including Parkinson’s disease, following moderate or severe TBI\nunprovoked seizures, following moderate or severe TBI\ndementias (presenile dementia of the Alzheimer’s type, frontotemporal dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies), if the condition manifests within 15 years following moderate or severe TBI\ndepression, if the condition manifests within three years of moderate or severe TBI or within 12 months of mild TBI, or\ndiseases of hormone deficiency that result from hypothalamo-pituitary changes, if the condition manifests within 12 months of moderate or severe TBI.\nEntitlement to secondary SC for these TBI-related conditions under 38 CFR 3.310(d) depends upon the initial severity of the TBI and the period of time between the injury and onset of the secondary illness.\nImportant:  There is no need to obtain a medical opinion to determine whether the above conditions are associated with TBI when there is a TBI of a qualifying degree of severity.\nNotes:\nDetermine the initial severity level of the TBI based on the TBI symptoms at the time of the original injury, or shortly thereafter, rather than the current level of functioning.\nRegional offices (ROs) must continue to follow guidance in M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 12.B.2 when evaluating residuals of TBI.  However, ROs must follow guidance in this topic when establishing secondary SC for claimants who have experienced a TBI in service and later develop one of the five diagnosable conditions listed in 38 CFR 3.310(d).\nThe determination of initial severity is adjudicative – although based on medical evidence.  That means the rating activity must decide the facts, such as initial severity, that correspond with the legal standard set forth in the regulation.\nReferences:  For more information on\nusing the TBI initial severity table in 38 CFR 3.310(d) and how to proceed if the level of severity cannot be determined based on the available evidence, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 12.B.3.c, and\nevaluating evidence and making findings of fact to support conclusions of law, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 1.A.\nV.iii.12.B.3.b.  Evaluating the Initial Severity of TBI\nFor purposes of determining the initial severity of the TBI, consider the factors from the table in 38 CFR 3.310(d).  Review medical records and lay statements for evidence of\nstructural imaging of the brain, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) scans\nloss of consciousness (LOC)\nalteration of consciousness/mental state (AOC), including disorientation\npost-traumatic amnesia (PTA), including any loss of memory, and\nGlasgow Coma Scale (GCS), which provides a measurement of the degree of coma at or after 24 hours.\nReference:  For more information on verifying in-service blast injuries, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 12.B.1.d.\nV.iii.12.B.3.c.  Using the TBI Initial Severity Table in 38 CFR 3.310\nThe TBI does not need to meet all the criteria listed under a certain initial severity level in order to classify the TBI under that severity level.\nIf the Veteran’s TBI meets the criteria in more than one severity level, classify the initial severity at the highest level in which a criterion is met.\nBecause “normal structural imaging,” “abnormal structural imaging,” and “AOC greater than 24 hours” may be found at more than one severity level, classify severity based on other criteria in the table.  If no other criteria are present, then determine the level of severity as follows:\nIf AOC is greater than 24 hours and no other criteria are present, determine the severity as moderate.\nIf structural imaging is noted as normal and no other criteria are present, determine the severity as mild.\nIf structural imaging is noted as abnormal and no other criteria are present, determine the severity as moderate.\nIf the level of severity cannot be determined based on the available evidence, then apply the provisions of 38 CFR 3.310 (a) and (b) and order a VA examination/medical opinion as necessary.\nV.iii.12.B.3.d.Evidence That May BeRelevant tothe InitialSeverity Factors\nEvidence that may be relevant in ascertaining the initial severity of TBI symptoms includes\nlay statements provided by the Veteran\nlay statements from witnesses to the injury\nhistory provided by the Veteran in medical reports, to include VA exams, and\nSTRs findings at any time after the TBI.\nNote:  The evidence that establishes the initial severity of the TBI does not necessarily have to be contemporaneous to the injury as long as it relates to the condition of TBI at or shortly after the time of the injury.\nExample:  A Korean War Veteran submits a claim for SC for Parkinsonism secondary to his SC TBI.  The Veteran’s discharge examination from 1954 mentions a history of TBI in service.  However, it does not contain information sufficient to determine the level of severity of the initial TBI injury.  The Veteran provides a statement that he experienced a loss of consciousness during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir.  A review of prior VA examination reports reveals a history provided by the Veteran that he was told by fellow soldiers that he fell unconscious for almost an hour after two grenades exploded near him.\nAnalysis:  Although service records do not reveal the specific level of TBI during service, the Veteran’s statement is credible, consistent with circumstances of his service, and therefore sufficient to determine that he experienced a moderate level of TBI during service.\nV.iii.12.B.3.e.  Determination of Diagnosable Conditions as Secondary to TBI\nUse the table below to determine secondary SC for conditions listed in 38 CFR 3.310(d).\nIf there is a diagnosis of …\nAnd the initial severity of the TBI was …\nThen …\nParkinsonism, including Parkinson’s disease\nmoderate or severe\naward SC.\nunprovoked seizures\nmoderate or severe\naward SC.\ndementia of the following types:\npresenile dementia of the Alzheimer type\nfrontotemporal dementia, and\ndementia with Lewy bodies\nmoderate or severe\naward SC if dementia manifested within 15 years after the TBI.\ndepression\nmoderate or severe\naward SC if depression manifested within three years after the TBI.\nmild\naward SC if depression manifested within one year after the TBI.\na disease of hormone deficiency that results from hypothalamo-pituitary changes (any condition in the endocrine system section of the rating schedule, 38 CFR 4.119, DCs 7900-7912, or any condition evaluated analogous to one of those conditions)\nmoderate or severe\naward SC if the condition manifested within one year after the TBI.\nV.iii.12.B.3.f.  Considerations When Establishing Secondary SC\nWhen evaluating TBI-related secondary conditions, avoid pyramiding when considering the initial TBI evaluation and symptoms that are now associated with the five secondary conditions.  Also, consider Notes (1) and (2) under 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8045, while ensuring that the claimant receives the highest overall evaluation under the provisions of 38 CFR 4.25 (Combined Ratings Table).\nDepending on the most advantageous combined evaluation, it is permissible to reduce an existing TBI evaluation as long as the overall evaluation of both TBI and the separate secondary SC condition is not reduced.  Use the combinator tool in VBMS-R to determine the combined evaluation of TBI and the secondary SC condition.  Thoroughly explain the decision in the Narrative section of the rating decision.\nUse the table below to consider symptoms which apply to both TBI and the secondary conditions listed in 38 CFR 3.310(d).\nIf ...\nThen ...\nthe symptoms associated with one of the five conditions were also used to provide the highest level of evaluation for any facet under 38 CFR 4.124a, DC 8045\nconsider removing evaluation of the facet, and\nuse the next highest-evaluated facet as the evaluation for the TBI residuals, as long asthe symptoms of that facet are not used to establish SC for one of the five diagnosable conditions.\nthe same symptoms apply to both disabilities\nevaluate the evidence and determine whether the symptoms can be entirely associated with one disability versus the other disability, and\ndo not request an additional medical examination for this determination.  If it is unclear, assume that the manifestations are not separable.\nthe same symptoms apply to both disabilities, and the symptoms are clearly associated with one disability versus the other disability\nselect the most advantageous option from the following:\nOption\nActions\n1\nRemove symptoms from the TBI facet\nevaluate the TBI under the next highest-evaluated facet that does not contain those symptoms\naward secondary SC for the diagnosable condition, and\nevaluate the secondary condition using those symptoms.\n2\nKeep the symptoms under the TBI facet, and\ndo not award secondary SC for the diagnosable condition, but\nensure the diagnosable condition is included with the description of the SC TBI disability in the rating decision.\n3\nKeep the symptoms under the TBI facet\naward secondary SC for the diagnosable condition, and\nevaluate based on the distinct symptoms.\nReference:  For more information on evaluating TBI residuals, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 12.B.2.b.\nV.iii.12.B.3.g.Action When Evidence Shows a 38 CFR 3.310(d) Condition\nUse the table below to determine how to proceed when evidence shows one of the five diagnosable conditions in 38 CFR 3.310(d).\nIf ...\nThen ...\none of the five diagnosable conditions in 38 CFR 3.310(d) is identified in the evidence of record while processing a claim unrelated to SC TBI\na claim for that secondary condition must be invited.\nevidence shows one of the five diagnosable conditions while evaluating a claim related to SC TBI\ndevelop under normal claim processing procedures and make a determination on the secondary condition under the provisions of 38 CFR 3.310(d).\nV.iii.12.B.3.h.  Determining Effective Dates for Secondary Conditions\nThe rule authorizing VA to establish the five secondary TBI-related conditions in 38 CFR 3.310 is effective January 16, 2014.\nThis rule will be applied to all cases pending before VA on or after January 16, 2014, and does constitute a liberalizing VA regulation under 38 U.S.C. 5110(g) and 38 CFR 3.114.  Apply these principles when determining effective dates and retroactive benefits.\nReference:  For more information on 38 CFR 3.114(a), see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 4.A.6.\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, Chapter 14 - Dental and Oral Conditions\nArticle ID: 554400000180509\nUpdated May 28, 2025\n<-- Previous Section   Next Section -->\nOverview\nIn This Chapter\nThis chapter contains the following topics:\nTopic\nTopic Name\n1\nGeneral Principles for Rating Dental and Oral Conditions for Compensation Purposes\n2\nRating Specific Dental and Oral Conditions\n1.  General Principles for Rating Dental and Oral Conditions for Compensation Purposes\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information on and general principles for rating dental and oral conditions for compensation purposes, including\ninterpreting claims raising dental issues\ngeneral information on service connection (SC) for dental and oral disabilities for compensation purposes\ndental/oral contentions for which compensation-purpose SC may not be established\ndental examinations in compensation claims for a dental disability\ndenying dental claims for SC compensation\nschedule of ratings for dental and oral conditions, and\ndental-oral rating schedule changes.\nChange Date\nOctober 10, 2019\nV.iii.14.1.a.  Interpreting Claims Raising Dental Issues\nService connection (SC) for dental/oral disabilities and conditions can be established for\ncompensation purposes, or\ntreatment purposes only.\nGenerally assume that a claim for a dental/oral disability or condition, filed on a prescribed form, seeks SC for compensation purposes unless the claim’s wording clearly communicates pursuit of dental treatment, in which case, follow procedures found in M21-1, Part XIII, Subpart i, 4.B.1.a.\nImportant:\nUnder 38 CFR 3.381(a), the Veterans Benefits Administration will adjudicate a claim for SC of a dental condition for treatment purposes after the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) determines a Veteran meets the basic eligibility requirements of 38 CFR 17.161.  Therefore, do not address as an actionable contention, or in the setting of a rating decision, the issue of SC for treatment purposes unless prompted to do so by a specific request from VHA.\nThe rating principles discussed in this section are specific to determinations of SC for compensation purposes.  Rating for dental treatment purposes, conversely, is discussed in M21-1, Part XIII, Subpart i, 4.C.\nReferences:  For more information on\nprocessing dental treatment requests, see M21-1, Part XIII, Subpart i, 4.B, and\nclarifying claims, see M21-1, Part III, Subpart i, 2.D.1.c.\nV.iii.14.1.b.  General Information on SC for Dental and Oral Disabilities for Compensation Purposes\nClaims for SC of dental and oral disabilities are developed and decided pursuant to the same policies and procedures that apply to SC for compensation purposes of conditions of other body systems.\nWhen notifying a Veteran of a decision to grant compensation-purpose SC for a dental or oral disability, include language to the following effect in the rating decision narrative:\nAlthough your dental condition or disability is service-connected, eligibility for treatment for that disability is limited by statute.  You may not be eligible for VA dental care.\nPlease contact the VHA facility that is nearest your home for a determination on whether you are eligible for treatment for your service-connected dental condition or disability.\nReference:  For more information on interpreting claims raising dental issues and the definition of a dental disability, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 14.1.a.\nV.iii.14.1.c.  Dental/Oral Contentions for Which Compensation-Purpose SC May Not Be Established\nGenerally, and unless otherwise contraindicated, any dental/oral condition that may be rated under, or by appropriate analogy to, the diagnostic code (DC) criteria of 38 CFR 4.150 is potentially subject to SC for compensation purposes.\nHowever, the following are prohibited from being deemed service-connected (SC) for compensation purposes:\ntreatable carious teeth\nreplaceable missing teeth\ndental or alveolar abscesses\nperiodontal disease\ndental calculi\nthird molars\nimpacted or malposed teeth (and other similar developmental defects), and\nteeth extracted because of chronic periodontal disease.\nNote:  38 CFR 4.150, DC 9913, does permit and provide for potential compensation-purpose SC for missing teeth; however, it also requires that such tooth loss be associated with underlying bone (maxilla/mandible) loss acquired as a result of\nservice trauma, as discussed in M21-1, Part XIII, Subpart i, 4.C.1, or\nnon-periodontal disease, such as osteomyelitis.\nReferences:  For more information on conditions that may be considered SC for\ntreatment purposes only, see M21-1, Part XIII, Subpart i, 4.C.1, and\nneither compensation nor treatment purposes, see M21-1, Part XIII, Subpart i, 4.C.1.\nV.iii.14.1.d.Dental Examinations in Compensation Claims for a Dental Disability\nObtain a dental examination for purposes of SC or evaluation purposes when necessary.\nDental examinations are considered specialist examinations.\nReferences:  For more information on\nwhen an examination is necessary under the duty to assist for a dental or other disability, see M21-1, Part IV, Subpart i, 1.A and B, and\nspecialist examinations, see\nM21-1, Part IV, Subpart i, 2.A.1.h, and\nM21-1, Part IV, Subpart i, 2.A.6.\nV.iii.14.1.e.Denying Dental Claims for SC Compensation\nConsider the issue of SC for compensation purposes for the conditions listed in 38 CFR 3.381(b) in a formal rating and deny the claim if\na Veteran claims compensation for one of these conditions, and\nthe record shows no complicating condition that is subject to SC.\nIn the Narrative of the rating decision, discuss that under 38 CFR 3.381(b) SC for such conditions can be established only for treatment purposes, and note if dental treatment in service was limited to conditions affecting only the teeth or gums.\nV.iii.14.1.f.  Schedule of Ratings for Dental and Oral Conditions\nThe schedule of ratings for dental and oral conditions are contained at 38 CFR 4.150.\nImportant:  When there is competent and credible medical evidence of impairment associated with conditions listed in 38 CFR 4.150 DCs that cannot be evaluated within the listed diagnostic criteria, that impairment must be evaluated separately.  Examples of potentially-associated impairments include (but are not limited to)\nloss of\nvocal articulation\nsmell, or\ntaste\nneurological impairment\nrespiratory dysfunction, or\nother impairments (such as scars).\nImportant:  The guidance on other impairment associated with dental and oral conditions was added as Note (2) to changes to 38 CFR 4.150 effective September 10, 2017.  However, as currently provided in M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.A.2.c, when deciding expressly claimed issues, decision makers must consider entitlement to any complications that are within the scope of the claim including those identified by the rating criteria.\nReference:  For more information on the dental-oral rating schedule changes, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 14.1.g.\nV.iii.14.1.g.  Dental-Oral Rating Schedule Changes\nA final rule made amendments to the rating schedule provisions for dental and oral conditions (38 CFR 4.150) effective September 10, 2017.  The changes were notconsidered liberalizing.\nReference:  For more information on handing claims when there are regulatory changes, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 4.A.\n2.  Rating Specific Dental and Oral Conditions\nIntroduction\nThis topic contains information on rating specific dental and oral conditions, including\ndiagnostic imaging confirmation requirement for evaluations based on nonunion of the mandible or maxilla\nspecial considerations in evaluations for temporomandibular disorder (TMD), and\ndefinition and evaluation guidelines for bruxism.\nChange Date\nMay 27, 2020\nV.iii.14.2.a. Diagnostic Imaging Confirmation Requirement for Evaluations Based on Nonunion of the Mandible or Maxilla\nUnder 38 CFR 4.150, DC 9903, nonunion of the mandible requires confirmation by diagnostic imaging studies.\nUnder 38 CFR 4.150, DC 9916, maxillary nonunion requires confirmation by diagnostic imaging studies.\nAs defined in the note to 38 CFR 4.150, diagnostic imaging studies include but are not limited to\nconventional radiography (x-ray)\ncomputed tomography (CT)\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\npositron emission tomography (PET)\nradionuclide bone scanning, and\nultrasonography.\nThe term nonunion refers to incomplete healing after an adequate healing period with fibrous union and mobility of fracture segments.\nImportant:  An actual copy of the imaging study does not need to be present in the claims folder.  However, the folder must reflect confirmation that the imaging was reviewed by the examiner.\nNote:  Although this is a new regulatory requirement, added to 38 CFR 4.150effective September 10, 2017, the September 2016 version of the Oral and Dental Conditions Including Mouth, Lips And Tongue (Other Than Temporomandibular Joint Conditions) Disability Benefits Questionnaire asks if x-rays or other studies, to include studies of the maxilla and mandible, have been conducted and instructs the examiner that if studies supporting the diagnosis are already of record they do not have to be repeated.  For cases pending on the effective date of the change of law, September 10, 2017, if there is a diagnosis of nonunion unsupported by diagnostic studies, obtain clarification.\nV.iii.14.2.b.  Special Considerations in Evaluations for TMD\nTemporomandibular disorder (TMD) (which may also be called temporomandibular joint dysfunction (“TMJD” or more colloquially TMJ”)) is evaluated under 38 CFR 4.150, DC 9905.  Evaluation levels are based on\nlimitation of inter-incisal range of motion (with or without dietary restrictions), or\nrange of lateral excursion.\nWhen assigning an evaluation there are a number of considerations.\nFor Department of Veterans Affairs purposes, normal maximum unassisted range of inter-incisal motion is 35 to 50mm.\nA 10-percent evaluation can be assigned for no more than 34 mm of inter-incisal motion.\nUnder the prior version of the DC (effective prior to September 10, 2017), a 10-percent evaluation was available for motion up to 40 mm.\nFor each range of maximum assisted inter-incisal motion, the appropriate evaluation to assign will depend on whether or not the condition necessitates dietary restriction to mechanically-altered foods.\nThe regulation provides in Note (3) that mechanically altered foods are foods altered by blending, chopping, grinding, or mashing to make them easier to chew and swallow.  Mechanical alteration can be to one of four levels or gradations:  full liquid, puree, soft, and semi-solid.\nThe note refers to dietary restrictions in which mechanically altered foods are required as texture modified diets.\nDietary restrictions involving any textured modified diet (any grade of mechanically altered food) must be recorded or verified by a physician.\nA contention or testimony by an individual that he or she is using a texture modified diet or requires one due to the SC condition is not sufficient to establish that the condition necessitates a texture modified diet with restriction to mechanically altered foods.\nEndorsement of the need for the dietary restriction to mechanically altered foods by a competent medical professional is required.  An examination report may satisfactorily record or verify that the SC condition necessitates the dietary restriction to mechanically altered food.\nWith respect to inter-incisal range of motion, the DC requires ranges be “unassisted.”  This means active range of motion.\nIn assigning an evaluation for TMD or any other dental disability on the basis of limited motion of temporomandibular articulation under 38 CFR 4.150, DC 9905, do not assign separate evaluations for limited inter-incisal motion or painful motion involving each side of the jaw.  Doing so is pyramiding.  Only one evaluation may be assigned.\nIf both sides of the jaw are affected, use the limitation of motion on the side that affords the highest evaluation.\nExample:  Maximum unassisted inter-incisal motion is limited to 34 mm on the right and 25 mm on the left.  There is no dietary restriction to mechanically altered foods.  There is credible evidence of actually painful motion of both sides of the jaw.  Assign a single 20-percent evaluation under 38 CFR 4.150, DC 9905.  Do notassign separate 10-and 20-percent evaluations.\nDo not combine ratings for limited inter-incisal motion with a rating based on limitation of lateral excursion of the jaw.\nReferences:  For more information on\nentitlement to a single rating for limitation of inter-incisal motion to include as due to painful motion, see Vilfranc v. McDonald, 28 Vet.App. 357 (2017)\npainful motion for joint conditions under 38 CFR 4.59, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, 1.A.1\nchoice of law for cases pending at the time of a regulatory change, see M21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 4.A.6, and\nthe prohibition against pyramiding, see\n38 CFR 4.14, and\nM21-1, Part V, Subpart ii, 3.D.2.b.\nV.iii.14.2.c.  Definition and Evaluation Guidelines for Bruxism\nBruxism is defined as excessive grinding of the teeth and/or excessive clenching of the jaw.  It may not be evaluated as a stand-alone SC disability."
