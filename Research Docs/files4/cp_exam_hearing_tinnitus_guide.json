        "how_exam_works": "Unlike other C&P exams, hearing exams are highly objective. You'll sit in a soundproof booth, wear headphones, and listen for tones. A machine measures exactly what you can and cannot hear. There's no physical manipulation, no pain, and no subjective interpretation.",
        "rating_info": {
          "hearing_loss": "Your rating (0% to 100%) is based on a mathematical formula using pure tone threshold averages (how loud sounds must be for you to hear them) and speech recognition scores (how well you understand spoken words).",
          "tinnitus": "The maximum rating is 10%—regardless of severity. However, tinnitus is one of the easiest conditions to service-connect because it's subjective (only you can hear it). If you had noise exposure in service and now have ringing in your ears, you'll likely be granted service connection.",
          "important_note": "Even a 10% tinnitus rating adds to your combined rating and can help you reach higher compensation brackets."
